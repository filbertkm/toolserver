Here THE BIG PICTURE shows the supplying of our troops with food, equipment and clothing; the continual research program of the QM; and, the latest in supply technique, aerial supply. This is the procedure of moving supplies from storage areas to airfield to drop zone, including the packaging and parachute-rigging of heavy equipment. Circumventing enemy defenses and natural obstacles, aerial supply represents a major advance in American military science. Captain Cecil W. Hospelhorn, who was a commanding officer of an aerial supply company in Korea, tells a thrilling story of the dropping of a complete bridge by air to isolated troops. Captain Hospelhorn is from Bloomington, Illinois. Now at the Advanced Officers' Training QM School at Fort Lee, Virginia, Captain Hospelhorn was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work in Korea. Colonel Russell K. Kuhns, Chicago, Illinois, is also interviewed. Colonel Kuhns tells of the monumental job of QM supply in Korea. He was the Deputy Chief to the 8th Army QM and is now Chief of the Research and Development Laboratory at the QM Depot, Jeffersonville, Indiana.

Again, former Army Secretary Frank Pace, Jr. is the guest of THE BIG PICTURE to introduce a program of interest to every taxpayer. It's the story of the war the Army fights all the time -- the war against waste. Our cameras go to Japan for Operation Rollup, showing how we supply our troops with rehabilitated (but efficient) equipment and thereby save the taxpayer millions of dollars. We see how our troops are encouraged to be 'cost conscious' about their tools of warfare. It takes dollars to build and maintain an effective fighting machine, but the Army is making a continual effort to keep that cost to a minimum. The soldier; who is a taxpayer too, knows the cost of our defense effort.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Citizen, Soldier and Taxpayer, Too","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569464","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1971-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration - ARC Identifier 3033306 / Local Identifier 175.79 - Operation Red Hat : Men and a Mission - Department of Defense.

Across dangerous wastes of ice and snow the camera lens follows these engineer soldiers as they construct roads stretching deeper and deeper into the Arctic. As Army civilian scientists and soldiers of the First Engineer Arctic Task Force penetrate deeper into the Arctic vastness, new problems and new dangers present themselves. In some places, the snow and ice covering the land prevent the engineers from reaching the dirt, or fill, needed for road building. Men and vehicles must travel over the snow. But as the shape of the land far below alters, hidden changes take place in the unseen snow layers underfoot. Dangerous, man-killing crevasses -- great vaults and hundred-foot caverns -- are formed. All this and more is captured on film for THE BIG PICTURE. It is a challenge, a frontier which must be conquered. American ingenuity, determination, and scientific skill are dedicated to this task.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Research and Development in the Arctic","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569635","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569773 / Local Identifier 111-TV-538<br /><br />Big Picture: The Army Chaplain: Yesterday and Today<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

Our first Army Chaplains were New England preachers who went to war with the men of their parish to help create a free nation under God. Since then the Army Chaplain has been a source of spiritual comfort and moral guidance to soldiers in all our wars, winning the nation's respect for service, often beyond the call of duty. Today he serves an ever-widening congregation - servicemen and their families in the United States and throughout the world. His role as a spiritual leader in past and modern wars is the subject of today's THE BIG PICTURE.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Army Chaplain: Yesterday and Today","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569773","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1942-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"Department of Defense.

This film warned that decontamination of vehicles and persons were vitally important after a chemical, biological, or radiological attack. After an attack, units should have marked contaminated areas with approved signs indicating the time, date, and agent used. The four methods of decontamination were natural, removing, covering, and destroying. The first method, natural decontamination, was the easiest of all the methods for removing biological and chemical agents. Wind, evaporation, rain, sunlight and aging all decay biological, chemical, and radiactive material from fallout. The second method, removing, had both a wet and dry process. The dry process required brushing, wiping, or scraping CBR agents. The wet process used soapy water and disinfectant to decontaminate CBR agents. The third method, covering, used waste disposal and earth to cover the radioactive material from fallout. The fourth method, destroying, contained three methods of destruction. Super tropic bleach (STB) worked to decontaminate the Center for Disease Control's (CDC's) Agent B and G categories. Decontamination Solution 2 (DS2) decontaminated all known biological agents on rubber, plastic, and metal. It was best used on tactical vehicles and weapons. Burning was used for liquid agents. Radiological agents could not be destroyed through destruction.

ARC Identifier 11887 / Local Identifier 57.8. Provides training in the techniques of photo interpretation for the discovery and evaluation of the natural resources of a country or region. The film begins with a summary of the idea of \"resources,\" and their development by mankind for a variety of purposes. Early on in the film the case is presented for the verification of information by a study of the ground area, and an understanding of ground truth. The use of aerial photography is introduced first by showing how trees and vegetation coverage is evaluated and interpreted by the Forest Service. In this sequence, kinds of timber are differentiated and their images on photography examined. The difference between soft pine and hardwood deciduous trees is noted on the photos. Further analysis carried out by use of counting of crowns in measured areas, and by looking at crown size and forest density. A second segment details how Geologic maps can be made and benefit from aerial photographic interpretation. It is noted that color imagery adds a ueful and helpful dimension to the process of detecting certain minerals and formations. Ground Truth observations, and verification for accuracy of interpretation are stressed. The interpreter should have direct familiarity with the various areas he is mapping and interpreting. In the third segment, soil mapping by photo interpretation is covered. Large areas can be quickly and relatively accurately characterized, but an emphasis on ground truth and familiarity with soil types, and soil chemical analysis is given substantial weight. The general correlation of the soils and the chemistry of them with local geological structure and water abundance is also intimated. The fourth segment discusses photo interpretation of hydrologic detail. Again,ground truth is emphasized to allow characterization of hydrology from the specific to the general to be made with confidence. Vegetation and geologic structure also arefactors which are considered in the hydrologic photo-interpretation.<br /><br />DVD copied by Justin Grimes.","title":"Introduction to Photo Interpretation","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.11887","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1961-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />Freedom Seven<br /><br /> National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

These products and techniques have become an essential element of this country's national defense establishment. Dramatically filmed for THE BIG PICTURE television series, this episode shows how the ordnance engineering and research centers (most of them known as \"arsenals\") perform several major jobs in making it possible for the Ordnance Corps to design, procure, supply, and maintain the lethal weapons for the Army's combat units. As explained in the film, these arsenals work in coordination with private engineering and research institutions, both educational and industrial. The achievements of Army ordnance may be attributed in large part to the cooperative efforts of what is often called the Ordnance-Science-Industry team. The Army has long known that each member of this group plays an indispensable part in our technological development, whether it be for the military and its mission or in basic research. \"Arms for Tomorrow\" is a look-see at America's firepower today--an achievement in military techniques--which meets the demands of our modern Army for swift and powerful striking force to defend our country. Viewers will see how this unique firepower and mobility are developed by the United States Army Ordnance Corps through its dynamic arsenal system.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Arms for Tomorrow","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569732","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1970-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />CHANGE OF TENANT CEREMONY (1ST INF DIV)<br />ARC Identifier 33475 / Local Identifier 111-LC-55455 1970<br /><br />Department of Defense.

Hungarian freedom fighters dramatically filmed on Army's \"THE BIG PICTURE,\" \"Operation Mercy\" -- From the bloody streets of Budapest, through the border escape routes into Austria and finally to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, \"Operation Mercy\" as shot and documented on THE BIG PICTURE becomes a most compelling story. In this film presentation, the \"human side\" of the Army is identified in the contributions of the American soldier assigned to \"Operation Mercy.\" Not so long ago thousands of Hungarian Freedom Fighters and their families were helped toward sanctuary in the United States. For them the gates of Camp Kilmer represented the end to a way of life they had found oppressive and the beginning of a new life of hope and opportunity. The action moves from the early street fighting in Budapest through the last days in October when the thunderous roar of Russian tanks was stilled and the smoke cleared over the ruined city to a ship moving out of Bremerhaven toward a pier in Brooklyn. Here all Americans -- along with the United States Army -- did not turn their backs, but pitched in to do a job for the valiant men and women of Hungary. Depicted in \"Operation Mercy\" are the many volunteer workers of the American Red Cross and other agencies working together at Camp Kilmer and at the American Embassy in Munich.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Operation Mercy","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569633","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569649 / Local Identifier 111-TV-381<br /><br />Big Picture: What Makes a General<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

It is the top of the ladder in the Army's educational system. From Washington's time to the present day of missiles and atomic warheads, we have looked to the Generals for leadership in maintaining our liberty and security from foreign oppression. THE BIG PICTURE examines and answers the question, \"What makes these men tick -- the Generals?\" The camera's eye is trained on their schooling and background which ultimately fits them for their missions. As this documentary film explains, when an Army General retires, more often then not, he is invited to take on towering responsibilities in civilian life -- positions where he can bring to bear his talents and training, along with the benefits of mature experience. Many a famous former wearer of the star has moved over to important jobs in the field of public welfare, education, business and commerce, and government service, accenting the respect Americans have not only for these men, but for the character, education, and training for which the rank of General stands.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: What Makes a General","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569649","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569674 / Local Identifier 111-TV-407<br /><br />Big Picture: Religious Emphasis Day in Philadelphia <br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

With countless words being written on the Army's scientific accomplishments and its technological advancements, many otherwise intelligent citizens are inclined to smile indulgently at the idea of animals participating in our military efforts. However, the old and trusted Army dog is not only still very much with us, but he too has become a specialist -- complete with a college education. THE BIG PICTURE cameras follow Bendix, a recently inducted German shepherd, as he undergoes the rigorous, demanding, and character building training now expected of all canine combateers. Taking part in the narration, Private Bendix describes how he and his buddies are patiently molded into vigilant guards, tireless messengers, and loyal sentinels protecting our missile bases from trespassers. And so, ironically, the progress in the fields of mechanized and technological warfare which might be expected to retire our old friend has instead provided a new mission for him and insured his position as a necessary part in our national defense.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Canine College","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569698","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1951-10-12T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration - ARC Identifier 95705 / Local Identifier LW-LW-17 - LONGINES CHRONOSCOPE WITH SEN, HOMER FERGUSON - TELEVISION INTERVIEW: Bruno Shaw and William Bradford Huie talk with Sen.

Hub of Army defense activities in Pacific shown on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- Although the islands of Hawaii have already had their share of publicity among tourist circles and travel bureaus, the Army Signal Corps takes time out to photograph in detail, and sometimes with dramatic impact, the picture of Army servicemen and women stationed in Hawaii. In \"Soldier in Hawaii,\" the producers of the Army's six year old TV series examine well the varied activities and responsibilities of a hard-hitting military force in Hawaii. Ground forces like the 25th \"Tropic Lightning\" Infantry Division have been pulled back to Hawaii from more forward areas in the Pacific to meet any sudden emergency and be airlifted to any trouble spot. In an interview with Governor Samuel King, the role of the National Guard in the defense picture of the islands is spelled out. As an illustration of the above, the filming of these Guardsmen on maneuvers, simulating combat conditions, is particularly exciting and adds much to this THE BIG PICTURE program. In any mood, serious or otherwise, THE BIG PICTURE takes it all in stride and consistently gives a good show for its millions of viewers at home and overseas.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Soldier in Hawaii","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569621","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569628 / Local Identifier 111-TV-359<br /><br />Big Picture: DEW Line<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert. Role of Army Transportation Corps in Artic shown on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- The complex, far-flung network of preparedness by which America keeps itself ready to fend off attack is the story behind this THE BIG PICTURE film presentation. Beyond the United States, far to the North, stretches the latest link in the gigantic network of sight and sound, the remote radar stations of the Distant Early Warning System which we call the DEW Line. To erect these stations in regions few men had ever seen a short decade ago was an achievement of great proportions. To man them, to keep them operating, to bring in adequate food, clothing, and equipment is another gigantic task -- and a continuous one. The job of carrying supplies and equipment to those remote arctic stations belongs to the Army Transportation Corps. \"DEW Line\" was filmed by two camera crews whose members followed the East and West Coast Task Forces through their special DEW Line training at Fort Eustis; departure in convoy from Hampton Roads, Virginia, and Seattle; rigors of the trip through the Arctic ice pack; preparations for discharge; and the difficult and diversified conditions encountered at the actual unloading sites. Today the frozen Arctic is a link in our vast chain of defense -- a chain kept strong by many hardworking individuals, not least of whom are the much traveled men of the Army Transportation Corps.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: DEW Line","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569628","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569639 / Local Identifier 111-TV-370<br /><br />Big Picture: Fifty Years of Aviation<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Army TV series begins new series with salute to aviation progress -- In a salute to aviation progress, the Army's TV series, THE BIG PICTURE, has packaged a neat surprise for viewers in this half-hour episode, \"Fifty-Years of Aviation.\" Beginning with historical footage from 1907 when the United States Army purchased the first military plane, this documentary examines the miracle of flight and pauses to consider what man has done in such a short half century. Apart from the hitherto, seldom-seen footage in this program, THE BIG PICTURE salutes the brave men and women whose courage, tenacity, and skill have directly resulted in Army, Navy and Air Force aviation power second to none. This is the Army's tribute to the pilots, the mechanics, the engineers and the countless others who have given wings to man's dreams.

American way of life portrayed on Army's television series, \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- In Ottumwa, Iowa, THE BIG PICTURE cameras have found a living example of the way of life and the true form of liberty of the American people. \"Ottumwa, U.S.A.\" is touchingly poignant in its exploration of the priceless heritage which is the American way of life. This is a visual record of Ottumwa at work, its youth, its schools, and its religious institutions. It is first the story of a city, and second, the story of the Army's involvement with a city. This is a different kind of story than is usually released in THE BIG PICTURE television series. From its opening scene, the film grows in its appeal to capture the charm and warmth of a Midwestern community. Around the meaning of freedom and liberty, writers Reginald Wells and Harry Middleton, and producer Ben Stelson constructed a succession of moods that reflect enormous style and imagination. There are hundreds of communities across the broad face of the nation that reflect the image of Ottumwa, Iowa... typical citadel of the American way of life.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Ottumwa, U.S.A.","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569655","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569668 / Local Identifier 111-TV-400<br /><br />Big Picture: Far East Military Assistance Advisory Groups (MAAGs) <br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Eight countries in Far East covered on film for \"THE BIG PICTURE\" series -- THE BIG PICTURE camera under the supervision of veteran combat cameraman, Captain Gaetano Faillace, travels to the Far East to record for television the story of those colorful and exotic countries. The film is a record of how they and the United States have been strengthened by the work of U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Groups stationed there. The military aid to the nations of the Far East is one of the most effective defenses the free world has against Communist aggression in that most vital area. Included among the countries visited are Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. Nowhere is the will and the strength to resist more vital to this country than in the Far East, some of which is already heavily scarred by Communist aggression since World War II. Passions not known to Americans stir many of these lands. War and its holocaust--the struggle for and birth of independence--these and others have brought their special problems. \"Far East MAAGs\" is a documentary that covers many miles of ground and many peoples of the world.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Far East Military Assistance Advisory Groups (MAAGs)","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569668","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569671 / Local Identifier 111-TV-403<br /><br />Big Picture: Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Nations <br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Southeast Asia examined on Army's \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and its contribution to our mutual security is the subject for this episode in the Army's THE BIG PICTURE weekly television series. The western Pacific and Asia are vitally important parts of the world to the United States. Not only does this area contain a large percentage of all mankind and tremendous resources, but it is also a place where the Communists are making vigorous and ruthless aggression. Based upon the belief that most Americans do not know too much about the SEATO countries, THE BIG PICTURE staff sent cameras into Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines. The result is a most unusual and dramatic episode in this seven-year-old television series. As pointed-up in the film, present Communist strategy in Southeast Asia is to undermine non-Communist governments by threat and subversion. In the three and a half years since SEATO's formation, the eight member nations have made long strides forward along the road to mutual security.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Nations","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569671","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1969-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"Department of Defense.

Not since the Civil War has a conflict provided the world with such a memorable list of military titans than those of World War II. THE BIG PICTURE, having presented the lives of Generals Marshal, MacArthur, and Stilwell, now turns to honor the Army's sister service with this pictorial biography of one of its most distinguished heroes -- Admiral Chester Nimitz. Raised on the extensive plains of Texas, Admiral Nimitz had never seen an ocean when he entered Annapolis at the beginning of the century. Yet, forty years later he rescued the world's largest body of water from the tyranny of one of the mightiest fleets ever assembled. His incredible and brilliant victories at Midway and the Coral Sea, at Okinawa and the Philippines, will remain forever as an example of the United States Navy's proudest heritage. THE BIG PICTURE captures the time, the battles, and the man in \"The Admiral Chester Nimitz Story.\" Using rare, previously unshown film, the viewer is taken back half a century to the early days of the Naval Academy, the Spanish-American War, and the time when Chester Nimitz and the U.S. Navy began to grow together to produce today's modern fighting force. The second half deals with his role during World War II, his contributions to strategy and leadership, and his personal example of courage and devotion that will always he admired by all men who follow the sea.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Admiral Chester Nimitz Story","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569700","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"Department of Defense.

This episode in the current THE BIG PICTURE series, filmed in Canada by U.S. Army Signal Corps cameramen, had its world premiere on October 28 at 9:30 P.M. over the coast-to-coast facilities of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Tracing the history of the Canadian Army from the middle of the 18th century to present, the film examines the historic relations of Canada and the United States. The fruitfulness of Canadian-American solidarity is nowhere more evident than in the shoulder-to-shoulder fighting shared by Canadian and American soldiers on the battlefields of Europe and Korea. Evident throughout the story is the vigorous neighborly spirit which has contributed so mightily to the strength of Canada and the United States alike. As presented on THE BIG PICTURE, Canada's modern Army embodies a living tradition begun long ago and nourished by the many soldiers who contributed service and sacrifice, who led its regiments and filled its ranks on the battlegrounds of the world.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Salute to the Canadian Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569680","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569699 / Local Identifier 111-TV-435<br /><br />Big Picture: The Dwight D.

Eisenhower Story\" deals exclusively with the general's life before becoming president, with emphasis on his military career.In as much as his life itself is straightforward, with a drama uniquely its own, the narration by Raymond Massey which accompanies this pictorial record is also straightforward and simple, setting forth the facts, and letting the facts and the picture tell the story. In telling this story of a great American military leader, THE BIG PICTURE camera visits Abilene, Kansas, and the Eisenhower Museum. By using the murals within the museum, the film dissolves into flashbacks in the life of a man who is at once a symbol and a leader of one of the greatest military victories ever won by the United States of America. The dramatic high point comes with the victorious adventure D-Day, and reflects on the incalculable importance of its outcome on the entire world, and on the responsibility it imposed on one man --Dwight D.

Actual samples are used including pamphlets, posters, broadcasts, photographs, and other material to show what enemy propaganda really is. To dramatically present this subject, THE BIG PICTURE includes stock footage and original shots to show the use of enemy propaganda during war and in peacetime situations. This film uses a narrator from the Office of Special Warfare, since that office, charged with the function of psychological warfare, contains those who are best able to recognize propaganda, describe its purpose, and discuss the methods of dissemination which may be utilized. Produced for troop information use this year, \"Defense Against Enemy Propaganda\" is being released for public television use on THE BIG PICTURE because of its tense and exciting approach to this much discussed subject.

Soldiers with an unusual occupation shown on \"THE BIG Picture\" -- THE BIG PICTURE has come up with a neat little documentary in \"Army Divers' School,\" filmed on location at Fort Eustis, Virginia. Director of Photography is SP-3 Gerald Finnerman of the Army Pictorial Center in Long Island City, and experienced and qualified cameraman from Warner Brothers Studio in Hollywood. Through his eyes and the lens of THE BIG PICTURE camera, TV viewers will follow the training and actual underwater operations assigned to enlisted divers of the Army Transportation Corps. The diving student learns and becomes a jack-of-all-trades: welder, carpenter, mechanic all rolled into one. He must also be an explosives expert; at home with such items as blasting machines, plastic explosives gelatin dynamite and TNT. Playing down the dramatics usually seen in underwater work, the skillful photography by Finnerman results in a documentary featuring generous use of all camera angles. It takes 17 weeks in the Divers' School for young soldiers who had never been under the water to become qualified salvage divers and fledgling members of one of the highest paid trades in the world.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army Drivers' School","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569634","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569670 / Local Identifier 111-TV-402<br /><br />Big Picture: Why NATO?<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

The story of NATO shown on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" television series -- In this issue of THE BIG PICTURE TV series, the cameras are focused on NATO -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Guest narrator for this filmed documentary is the distinguished commentator and news analyst, Mr. Edward R. Murrow. As shown in this episode, the United States as a founding member of this vital international body, has demonstrated to the world the importance we place on the closest association between the members of the Atlantic community. Throughout history, nations have sought through treaties and alliances with other nations, to maintain their security and remain free from attack. But not until the twentieth century did the concept of national security become worldwide in its scope. World Wars I and II and the Korean War proved beyond any doubt that when one free nation anywhere is threatened by aggression, the safety of all free nations is ultimately at stake. Dramatically presented on film, the United States is shown in its strategic role as leader in the free world and its alliance with other nations dedicated to the preservation of peace and the welfare of mankind.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Why NATO?","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569670","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569690 / Local Identifier 111-TV-425<br /><br />Big Picture: The Joseph Warren Stilwell Story <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"I claim we got a hell of a beating. We got run out of Burma and it is as humiliating as hell. I think we ought to find out what caused it, go back and retake it.\" So begins \"The Joseph Warren Stilwell Story,\" a pictorial record produced for THE BIG PICTURE television series, of both a \"hell of a beating\" and one of the most remarkable comebacks in military history. Here is all the color and excitement in the life of one of America's greatest soldiers: General Joseph Warren Stilwell -- his baptism of fire in World War I, the outbreak: of war in China, his gallant but doomed defense of Burma, the tragic withdrawal through enemy infested jungles, and finally, the magnificent counterpunch that turned humiliating defeat into complete victory. The overworked term \"Soldier's Soldier\" has lost much luster, but \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, sharing the hardships and dangers of his men, gave the phrase real meaning. His was the unique capacity for commanding respect and obedience while evoking genuine affection. General Stilwell died in 1946, but his career of service to his country will always remain an inspiration to greatness.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Joseph Warren Stilwell Story","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569690","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569697 / Local Identifier 111-TV-433<br /><br />Big Picture: The Common Defense<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. Here is a pictorial report on the meaning of the term \"the common defense\" which has changed a great deal since the time our founding father immortalized that phrase in the Constitution of the United States. In those days, the Army was the bulwark of the young nation's defense. But in the years and the wars that followed, the mighty Sister Services of the Navy and the Air Force came into being and developed equal stature. Today, the three services operate under a unified command, working together as the Armed Forces of the United States. Together, they share new weapons brought forth by the era of missiles and nuclear arms and contribute their resources to the military exploration of the new world of outer space. The Armed Forces form a mighty, flexible shield which by its very existence deters the sinister designs of the forces of aggression. THE BIG PICTURE pays tribute to the Army, Navy, and Air Force who form a valiant team that continues to discharge with glory its great and proud responsibilities -- the common defense of the United States.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Common Defense","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569697","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569701 / Local Identifier 111-TV-437<br /><br />Big Picture: The Hap Arnold Story<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. The birth and growth of our Air Force into the powerful fighting unit it is today began within the United States Army. During this period, for almost his entire forty-six years of service, General \"Hap\" Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Force, completely dedicated himself to building America's strength in the skies. America owes much to him for this development and for the air supremacy and victory in World War II. This is his life, brought to the television screen on THE BIG PICTURE series, as a modest, hard-working and good-natured man. The documentary begins in 1909 when a Frenchman by the name of Bleriot flew a frail contraption across the English Channel. A few weeks after, a young American lieutenant saw it and began to wonder even then about the military effects of many flying machines in the air at the same time. That young lieutenant, Henry \"Hap\" Arnold, was to be come the Commander of the greatest Air Force in history -- two and a half million men and seventy thousand aircraft.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Hap Arnold Story","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569701","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569711 / Local Identifier 111-TV-451<br /><br />Big Picture: Korea Today<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"KOREA TODAY\" IS FILM DOCUMENTARY ON REBIRTH OF A NATION --A few short years ago, the rugged Peninsula of Korea was the scene of some of the hardest and most bitter fighting of modern times. \"Korea Today,\" released for the Army's television series \"THE BIG PICTURE\" becomes a study of American soldiers helping a nation to help itself. As seen in this film, the savagery and violence created by the war have been wiped away with the generosity and love of the American soldier on duty in Korea. Housing, public buildings, businesses and transportation facilities have been patched together or constructed from scratch. American Army know-how, Army supervision, and Army equipment have played a vital role in this rehabilitation, working closely with the Korean people. Just as important has been the creation of a new Republic of Korea Army. This small force which was available for Korea's defense prior to the outbreak of the fighting, is now a part of history. Thousands of inexperienced young men have been trained by battle-seasoned American and Korean soldiers and turned into a smooth, well-drilled modern army, equipped with American weapons.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Korea Today","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569711","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1969-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />REDEPLOYMENT OF THE 9TH INF DIV<br />ARC Identifier 32912 / Local Identifier 111-LC-54657 1969<br /><br />Department of Defense.

The scatter radar technique is explained in simple animation sequences: high frequency radio waves penetrate the ionosphere; free electrons in the upper atmosphere respond by oscillating and scattering their energy incoherently; the ultra-powerful Jicamarca antenna picks up this faint incoherent scatter.

Company A is in a desperate situation. A major enemy offensive has succeeded in penetrating the front with such strength that the X Corps has been required to retire to the rear, leaving the company cut off and surrounded. There are many courses left to the company commander and the one he chooses is to stay and fight. So begins this episode from THE BIG PICTURE series. After two days and nights of continuous enemy attacks, he realizes that to remain will only result in the company's annihilation. The order is to divide into small groups and escape back to their own lines by infiltration, but before it can be carried out the enemy attacks again. Most of the company, including the company commander, are killed. Five men are taken prisoner. As they are marched off for interrogation they watch eagerly for some opportunity to escape. Finally, they take a chance and overpower the guards. During the pursuit two of the men manage to get away. For the three who are left another battle begins. They are separated and led through a series of interrogations, each more cleverly devised than the other. But they do not break and, like the men who succeeded in the escape, the victory is theirs. With this THE BIG PICTURE, the importance of the Code of Conduct which outlines the soldier's moral obligation to his country is made vivid and dramatic.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Code of the Fighting Man","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569693","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration - ARC Identifier 3021192 / Local Identifier 175.50 - Waterbucket II: E-8 Test on Ambush, ca. 1966 - Department of Defense.

This film is a U.S. Army \"Edgewood Arsenal Report\" on three chemical munitions systems that were under development by the U.S. Army. The E8, E158, and E159 were tested at Camp A. P. Hill, Virginia. In test one the goal was to test E158 and E159 to see if these aerial clusters prevented ambush by reconnaissance, and to determine the effects of the weapons on both masked and unmasked troops. The results showed that eighty-five percent of the area was covered and the majority of troops were incapacitated. In test two the goal was to see if E8 and E158 were effective for a daylight ambush on hostile foot columns. The results showed that the E158 cut off avenues of escape, and the E8 placed at the back and front of the column created a cloud over the killing zone. In test three the goal was to test daylight defense of a fixed installation. The results showed that the attack force was incapacitated. In test four the goal was to test an ambush and to see whether a friendly foot column that was initially unmasked could counter an ambush using launchers. The results showed that the friendly forces were able to incapacitate an enemy, but the enemy was able to flee from the cloud.

Skilled river drivers maneuvered the logs downstream, risking their limbs and lives every day. This film survives as a record of the long log business.

In Korea, the aggressor's challenge was met and turned back by the United Forces of the world's free nations. Yet in the backwash of war there always remains a second challenge -- the thousands of orphans, the millions of homeless, the countless villages and cities ravaged and almost completely destroyed. Our cameras focus on one such city, Seoul, the Capital of the Republic of Korea. It is the story of a city twice the parade ground of Communist troops, four times a battlefield. \"Rebirth of Seoul\" is also the story of man's enduring will to triumph in the face of the greatest adversity. With other free members of the United Nations, the United States met the Communist attack in Korea with bravery and sacrifice.

In America's wars of the past, this nation has achieved \"One Army\" unity without giving it particular thought. The combined thinking and efforts of all branches and all components, working as a team under the stress of wartime demands, has been the key to our victories in battle. As dramatically presented on film, it is during the actual months of combat when men shared the rigors, dangers, and accomplishments of war together, that there has been a unity of spirit, purpose, and action. On the front line--in the heat of battle--no one stopped to ask whether a man was a \"Regular,\" \"a Guardsman,\" or a \"Reservist.\" Yet, this unity was never achieved until after the battle began. Unfortunately, however, each time a wartime Army was demobilized following victory, its soldiers tended once more to think of themselves as Regulars, or National Guardsmen, or Reservists, rather than simply as soldiers of the United States Army. As brought forth in this documentary film, today all the Army's components have essential, indispensable roles all the time. No component can perform its mission without the support and cooperation of the other two. Like the Three Musketeers of Dumas' famous novel, they are \"All for one and one for all.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: One Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569721","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />PRESIDENT NIXON'S VISIT, JOHNSTON ISLAND, July 23-24, 1969<br /><br /> Department of Defense.

Today--for the first time in history--American military personnel are stationed on the soil of Great Britain in peacetime. Filmed against a backdrop of rolling countryside, villages, and historic landmarks, \"Soldier in Britain\" tells the story of Americans and Britains learning to live and work together. The American soldier's primary duty in Great Britain is to protect the numerous air bases of the Strategic Air Command. Quonset huts dot the landscape from one end of England to the other, and Englishmen going about their daily tasks may at any time hear an alert, and see troops from a friendly nation hastening off to an airbase to blaze away at a target. As the film unfolds, the television viewer will accompany the American soldiers stationed in Britain as they get to know Trafalgar Square (center of the City of London) as they watch a game of Rugby at Oxford, and visit historic Westminster Abbey.

In the first half, viewers are taken behind the scenes of the Army Exhibit Unit, an organization that mixes skill and showmanship to bring the heritage and accomplishments of the Army to the nation's front door. The second half deals with the biggest picture of them all: \"The American Way of Life,\" and how this image of freedom and good will was established to the world at the Brussels' World Fair. The Army Exhibit Unit might be called \"the Army's Strolling Players.\" Their stages are miniature, three-dimensional battlefields and missile displays so painstakingly recreated that one can almost hear the roar of rockets and taste the charred air.

In Brussels, the Signal Corps cameras covered the U.S. exhibit that placed emphasis not on what we have done, but on the kind of people we are.

Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy stars in this THE BIG PICTURE release. His two young sons' prying questions about space-age missiles prompt Murphy to make a tour of modern Army installations and revisit some of the places he saw in Europe during World War II. First stop is Germany and Hitler's stadium in Nuremberg. Moving on to Wurzburg, Murphy stops at the Third Division area and inspects the platoon he commanded as a First Lieutenant 15 years before. In Germany, the most decorated soldier of World War II gets a look at the Corporal missile and the Redstone missile. A side trip to Norway gives him an orientation view of the Nike Ajax and Hercules ground-to-air missiles. Returning to the United States, Lt. Gen. Arthur G. Trudeau gives the movie star a grand tour of White Sands Missile Range to watch the LaCrosse, the Little John, and the Hawk in action. A highlight of the White Sands visit is the successful firing of the mighty Sergeant missile. At his residence again, Murphy explains to his children about how the free world is being protected by the Army's arsenal of missiles.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Broken Bridge","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569746","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569749 / Local Identifier 111-TV-511<br /><br />Big Picture: Army Digest Number Eight<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

The \"The Mathew Brady Story\" brings to the television screen the work of the famed photographer who, during the Civil War, earned the title of \"The First Combat Photographer.\" In this documentary, Brady's crisp visual account of the Civil War and its men is brought to life as music, sound, and movement team up with Brady's photographic skill to give THE BIG PICTURE audience an authentic sense of what it was like to live and fight through the years when our nation's unity hung in the balance. In the \"Clara Barton Story,\" the personal chronicle of the woman who was instrumental in founding the Red Cross - the accounting, in her own words, of her part in a single day of the Battle of Antietam - is documented through scenes shot at the actual site of the battle, near Hagerstown, Maryland. Hagerstown residents ably portray Miss Barton and those with whom - and for whom - she worked, in the midst of that tragic day and night of fighting, adding visual drama to a narrative excerpted from words written by Clara Barton herself.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army Digest Number Eight","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569749","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569761 / Local Identifier 111-TV-524<br /><br />Big Picture: U.S. Army Combat Development Experimentation Center (CDEC) <br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

Just behind the Coastal Range of Central California, the U.S. Army has a new 250,000 acre natural laboratory where all sorts of military concepts for possible future conflict are tested and evaluated by the latest principles of scientific research. At the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation, top scientists and top soldiers first create, then supervise a series of controlled combat experiments to determine which organizational structures, which weapons and materiel, which tactics and techniques might be most effective in the years ahead. In this unusual THE BIG PICTURE, you will see simulated battle successes, defeats and casualties being recorded in a distant control center almost as soon as they take place on the testing ground. You will see how infra-red rays simulate artillery shells.

Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). The world has long been familiar with two military challenges posed by the forces of world communism - the challenge of nuclear war and the challenge of large-scale conventional war. The United States and the free world meet these challenges by maintaining the ability to fight both kinds of war-an ability so powerful it has deterred Communists from starting either kind. Today, we are seeing with increasing frequency evidence of another technique the Communists use whenever they consider the occasion appropriate...the technique of unconventional warfare -\"The Third Challenge.\" This challenge involves conspiracy, underground organization and terror. It encourages guerrilla warfare and avoids open conflict and risks by the oblique method of conquering other countries from within. This week's THE BIG PICTURE, narrated by Alexander Scourby, deals with that third challenge and depicts the United States capability to fight this type of war in the far flung reaches of the globe.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Third Challenge: Unconventional Warfare","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569809","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT LYNDON B.

This program brings viewers the inside story of military police operations from around the world. The story begins with two unidentified MPs beginning their training at the home of the Military Police at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Following these two soldiers through their training we see the results as applied in Europe and Korea. Shown in the film are scenes of the MP customs checkpoints along the border separating East and West Germany. We see the Military Policeman in his role of highway patrolman, and regular MP duties in which the MP helps the Infantry and Artillery move on to their training programs. Viewers will learn the meaning of the MP slogan \"of the troops and for the troops\" as they see MPs direct combat traffic in Korea and how these men guard supplies and equipment for our fighting forces up-front. Also shown are Military Police engaged in actual combat in Korea in anti-guerilla operations. Sea-going MPs are shown on duty in the harbor of Pusan.

The first story on this pictorial report concerns the 34th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade, a brigade on constant alert, for their positions in West Germany are just seconds away from possible enemy aggression. Two phases of training are shown in this report on The Big Brigade--the crossing of the Rhine River and deployment in pre-determined defense positions; and secondly, the testing of Brigade skills as they fire live ammunition side-by-side with British NATO allies and other American units. The manning of guns is not the only job of the United States Army in Western Germany and the second report in this film presentation deals with the saving of lives. This is the story of the men in white who stand behind soldiers in khaki--as they have throughout our military history. The camera, in order to cover medical evacuation activities, moves into a maneuver area and follows the doctors, nurses, and trained technicians who make sure that every simulated fallen soldier has the greatest possible chance to live.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report No. 28","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569636","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569725 / Local Identifier 111-TV-468<br /><br />Big Picture: The General George S.

No American leader was more colorful and more successful, stepping forth like some warrior of old--to lead and inspire vast forces of men. While the basic elements of \"The General Patton Story\" are combat sequences, the film documentary delves into the General's life with such intimate details as his inability to spell, although a model cadet at West Point. A believer in showmanship, he was aware that if the act could not be carried off in fine style, the men would see through it.

It points out that war has changed, is constantly changing. It is being remolded by a multiplicity of new instruments, tactics, strategies, and purposes. Only one element of combat remains constant. The human one. How is he prepared for the ever-changing contest where you don't get a second chance? The film illustrates how a civilian becomes, first, an individual soldier and second, a member of fighting units - the squad, platoon, and so forth. It explains that when units of battle group size and larger are trained in the field, the modern field training exercise or maneuver is required. Aware of the fact that we no longer will be allowed time to get ready for war, the point is made that we must be ready now. Then the film details the exacting preparations that go into a present day maneuver. It illustrates the various kinds of maneuvers that have been held to enable our troops to fight efficiently under any conditions in any terrain, and to utilize the latest weapons and strategies. Finally, the film illustrates some of the payoffs of training with the result in combat and concludes with a presentation of the current readiness of the Army as exemplified by STRAC.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: History of Maneuvers","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569744","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1921-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration - ARC Identifier 88967 / Local Identifier AFI-AFI-442 - INTERNATIONAL NEWS - 442 - American Film Institute.

Narrated in the language of the soldiers who were there, this dramatic film presentation concerns itself with the \"esprit de corps\" that arose among paratroopers of World War II and is continuing in the new \"Pentomic 101st.\" In bringing the past and present together, the camera lens is aimed at Army Chief of Staff General Maxwell Taylor, wartime commander of the 101st. His words are pointed and leave little doubt in the viewers' mind that \"speed, mobility and versatility are the key concepts\" behind the Army's \"new look.\" As the film ends, paratroopers of the 101st march forward to re-fulfill, if called upon, the prophecy made years ago -- that the 101st \"has a rendezvous with destiny.\" Special music was composed and conducted by Captain Samuel Louoda of the United States Army Band and includes the new \"101st Airborne March\" and \"'Screaming Eagles' March.\" The chorus of male voices, heard on the soundtrack, is the newly formed Official United States Army Chorus.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pentomic 101st","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569620","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569730 / Local Identifier 111-TV-473<br /><br />Big Picture: Project Modern Army Needs (MAN)<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. The first of the new episodes in the Army's weekly television series, THE BIG PICTURE, covers a three-day demonstration of today's Army capabilities and tomorrow's Army possibilities, called \"Project MAN.\" Industry, government, and military leaders were shown what the Army has and what the Army is developing to be prepared for war and to maintain the peace. Now, brought to the television screen for the first time in its entirety, \"Project MAN\" becomes a showcase of new Army hardware in review. The title \"Project MAN\" has a double significance. M-A-N stands for Modern Army Needs. That the initials should spell out the fundamental determining factor of the quality of an army, whatever its equipment, is both intentional and highly appropriate. In addition to the display and demonstration of Army weapons and equipment, most exciting footage has been assembled to show the skills of the Army Rangers. This is not only good, strong entertainment, but it emphasizes the point that the quality of the Army--any army--depends on the quality of its great fighting men. Scenes show Rangers in simulated hand-to-hand combat, very realistically performed; a demonstration of climbing techniques, leaps from a tower with the aid of a resilient rope to reach the ground in a second's time, and finally, shots of Rangers making long cable slides past large-scale underwater explosions.

The first, \"The Junior Essex Troop,\" is the story of an historic National Guard unit and a group of 150 boys, age 11 to 17. Viewers will see how, between them, soldiers and boys keep alive a tradition and a way of life now gone from the modern scene. The National Guard unit is the 102nd Armored Cavalry in West Orange, New Jersey. Formed in 1931 as a cadet auxiliary of the famous Essex Troop, the Junior Essex Troop is believed to be the only junior cavalry squadron in the country sponsored by a National Guard unit. The charter of the troop states as its purpose: \"to encourage patriotism, and to foster the love of horses among boys, and to train boys in the art of horsemanship, cavalry drill, marksmanship, military training and discipline.\" The Junior Essex Troop Horse Show, staged annually in which all the contestants are teenage or under, provides a colorful climax to the story. The second story, \"Umbrellas of the Sky,\" tells how in the years since man first realized an age-old dream and took to the air, the parachute has played a role of ever-increasing importance. Today, the parachutes, like flight itself, serve in hundreds of ways the purposes of both peace and combat. In the unusual scenes shown, THE BIG PICTURE brings to the television screen some of the highlights in the development of these \"Umbrellas of the Sky.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army Digest Number 3","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569735","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1967-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />RELIABLE ACADEMY (9TH INFANTRY DIVISION) BEN CAT, SOUTH VIETNAM<br />ARC Identifier 31587 / Local Identifier 111-LC-52167 1967<br /><br />Department of Defense.

The story of our soldiers on patrol duty in the Demilitarized Zone of Korea: THE BIG PICTURE to present, \"The Guns Are Silent ...,\" Korean truce documentary -- This week's THE BIG PICTURE program, second in the new fall series, is titled \"The Guns are Silent.\" American viewers will get a chance to see for themselves the story of our soldiers on patrol duty in the Demilitarized Zone of Korea, in this latest in the Army-produced series for TV. Korea is still a front-line area, though the guns are silent. This truce-line documentary was filmed in the Korean Sector which is patrolled by soldiers day and night, through summer and winter. In this zone, the patrols of the Army act as eyes for all U.S. forces in Korea. The mission is grim and serious - anything may happen at any time -and when and if it does - the troops whom you see in this program must spot that first false move. The patrols must report in by radio every half hour as they guard a boundary line marked by 1,092 signs printed in both English and Korean. This program is the story of one of these patrols as it makes its way along the border. THE BIG PICTURE's camera will probe beneath the surface activities of men in an alien land and bring U.S. viewers a graphic accounting of what it is like to be on duty in defense of freedom. \"The Guns are Silent\" is the story of men and the elements, men and their weapons, men and a potential aggressor force, but most of all, it is the story of American soldiers on duty at the very edge of the free world, on their guard at all times. The program serves as a timely reminder that what once happened in Korea must not happen again.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Guns Are Silent","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569607","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"Environmental Protection Agency<br /><br />EPA 744-V99-001 epa.gov<br /><br />EMS for Printers: It's a Bottom Line Benefit<br /><br />1999<br /><br />DVD Copied by This 21 minute video documents the experiences of two printers that developed EMSs for their companies.

Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). Two decades ago, the brutal war in Europe had spilled the blood of many nationalities. Europe's postwar agony had been compounded by centuries of neglect. In the unrest and chaos, Communism saw its greatest chance, and the years of Stalinist expansion began. But for war-torn Europe, these were also the years of the Marshall Plan, a humanitarian gesture which took no regard for politics. The face of Europe has been transformed to one of despair among the Communist satellites and of unprecedented prosperity among the free nations. This is the dramatic story of \"The Changed Face of Europe.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Changed Face of Europe","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569840","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569843 / Local Identifier 111-TV-645<br /><br />Big Picture: World Trouble Spots<br /><br />DVD Copied by Thomas Gideon - Department of Defense.

Actual samples are used including pamphlets, posters, broadcasts, photographs, and other material to show what enemy propaganda really is. To dramatically present this subject, THE BIG PICTURE includes stock footage and original shots to show the use of enemy propaganda during war and in peacetime situations. This film uses a narrator from the Office of Special Warfare, since that office, charged with the function of psychological warfare, contains those who are best able to recognize propaganda, describe its purpose, and discuss the methods of dissemination which may be utilized. Produced for troop information use this year, \"Defense Against Enemy Propaganda\" is being released for public television use on THE BIG PICTURE because of its tense and exciting approach to this much discussed subject. In 28 minutes, viewers learn that the best defense against enemy propaganda is the ability to recognize it for what it is -- lies and distortions with little or no basis in fact. It concludes by pointing out that our country can never be defeated so long as we act like Americans.<br /><br />Made possible by a donation from Temperance Blalock.","title":"Defense Against Enemy Propaganda","identifier":"gov.archives.111-tv-360","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569627 / Local Identifier 111-TV-358<br /><br />Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 27 <br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert. Flood and fire covered on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- THE BIG PICTURE comes up this time with a pictorial report format, covering three separate stories instead of the usual single subject. However, the three stories are interrelated. The first deals with medicine, the second with experimentation, and the third with construction. But all are concerned with some of the Army's peacetime roles. Tornado and fire set the scene for \"Exercise Firedrill,\" staged at Brooke Army Hospital, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Here is a test, and thoroughly convincing, example of how a hospital might best handle mass civilian casualties of a natural disaster. The mock disaster was slated to affect the City of San Antonio in which nearly 1,000 simulated casualties are treated at Brooke Army Hospital. Where the first chapter of the pictorial report dealt with the role of Army medicine in relation to civilian disaster, the second episode is concerned with the job of the Army's Corps of Engineers and the work it does in minimizing the effects of disasters before they occur. The camera moves in close for a view of the Waterways Experiment Station at Vicksburg, Mississippi, where a continuing study is being made of the effects of hurricanes and floods. As a wind-up to this half hour program, the work of the Army's Corps of Engineers is shown in scores of military assignments, both in war and peace.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 27","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569627","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1971-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 34987 / Local Identifier 111-LC-58248<br /><br />Cong Hoa Hospital, Burn Ward, Saigon, Republic of Vietnam<br /><br />Department of Defense.

The first part of this roll depicts burned patient, Nguyen-Van-Ut, to show his granulating burn wounds which are ready for grafting (arm, hand, legs). Nguyen-Van-Ut received his burns 9 March 1971 by phosphorous. The second burn patient on this roll, Nguyen-V-Trieu, is depicted to show his arm and deformity of hand caused by his granulating burn wounds, which are ready for skin grafting. Nguyen-V-Trieu received his wounds by a B-40 round on 18 May 1971. The third patient, Va-Van-Khief, an 11 year old boy, who received his burns by Kerosene on 2 May 1971, is depicted to show the prior grafting to his burned face, mid-section and legs before second-stage grafting.

Department of Defense. Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). A fascinating but little known organization is the Army Exhibit Unit which visually dramatizes vital parts of the Army's story. For the first story on \"Pictorial Report,\" THE BIG PICTURE shows you the operation of this unit and one of its most striking displays--the recreation of prison life in North Korea. The second feature is a documentary about the Japanese Security Guard. Since the end of World War II, Japan has been recovering steadily from the destruction and humiliation of that war. To the United States Army, which went to Japan as an occupation force, and stays there now by mutual consent as a protector, Japan has also been winning a place of honor and trust. One of the functions which reflects this trust is the operation of the Japanese Security Guard. The third subject deals with Mobile Map Service. The Army Map Service is the largest mapping service in the world. Among its components are the mobile mapping units which can follow combat organizations into action, producing on-the-spot large quantities of maps for the all-essential guidance of troops in battle. For this report, THE BIG PICTURE goes to Germany where viewers will see one of these mobile units in action. The final report is a look at the American Forces Network which supplies American style radio service to our Armed Forces in Europe. The men and women of the United States Army are the best equipped and the best trained in the world, and because of functions like the American Forces Network, the best informed.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 5","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569521","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569610 / Local Identifier 111-TV-341<br /><br />Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 22<br /><br />DVD Copied by IASL Master Scanner Liz Pruszko. Research scientists, magazine illustrators, features of latest \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- This week's chapter of THE BIG PICTURE brings viewers the story of Quartermaster Testing and Research and finally invites the audience to \"Meet the Artist\" in a featurette devoted to famed commercial artists who have done work for defense purposes. Part One of this latest pictorial report from the Army to the American citizen, originates at the Quartermaster Research and Development Center at Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. In this portion of the program, viewers will see, firsthand, some of the work being done by the more than 1,200 scientists who ensure that the Army is weatherproof, cold-proof, waterproof, flameproof, well shod, and well fitted. THE BIG PICTURE cameras will introduce viewers to the Army's \"Copper Guinea Pig,\" Willie, the robot who serves as stand-in during the hazardous research experiments. Other highlights include scenes of the unique Climatic Chambers--the Arctic Chamber and the Tropic Chamber--probably the only place on earth where the South Pole is but yards from the South Seas. Here, Army scientists determine whether clothing is warm or cool enough to ensure the finest equipped soldiers under any conditions. The program closes with a feature titled, \"Meet the Artist.\" Recently, the Department of Defense invited magazine artists to illustrate the various sections of the new Code of Conduct for American Prisoners of War. Appearing on the program from their studios, artists Steve Dohanos, Harold Von Schmidt, Hardie Gromatky, Tom Lovell and Alex Ross each discuss the illustrations which they have created to guide servicemen and women if ever taken prisoner.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 22","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569610","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569718 / Local Identifier 111-TV-461<br /><br />Big Picture: Operation Danville<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"Operation Danville\" on the screen becomes a timely journalistic study of what can happen to an American community overrun by enemy forces and later liberated by friendly troops of the 82nd Airborne Division who parachuted into the area, engaged the enemy, and won after a pitched battle. This military operation was the climax of a large-scale field problem known as Exercise Dragon Head in which more than 11,000 Strategic Army Corps soldiers tested their brains and their fighting skills against an aggressor force. In its boldness and interest, \"Operation Danville\" depicts the tremendous cooperation offered by a community in Virginia to the United States Army at a time when the possibility of limited warfare is a continual threat to the uneasy peace under which we live. The narration covering the early footage of the picture displays admirable objectivity and refers to \"the look of Danville, Virginia, as the look of America. It is a look toward enduring prosperity and continuing peace. When Army officials asked Danville to become a part of Exercise Dragon Head, it was not surprising that the city enthusiastically agreed. The exercise would offer everyone a chance to see our modern Army in action and contribute directly to the training of STRAC soldiers.\" In sum, \"Operation Danville\" will leave an impression on the TV viewer that it doesn't seem like Danville, but instead, another place in another part of the world. It could be tomorrow, or the day after, but proves that the Army can handle limited war anyplace, anytime.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Operation Danville","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569718","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569724 / Local Identifier 111-TV-467<br /><br />Big Picture: United Service Organization (USO): Wherever They Go <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. The usual \"image\" in the public mind of the USO -- the United Service Organization -- is that of a dance, a USO show, a cup of coffee and a rendezvous point. But it is more as seen on THE BIG PICTURE in this documentary film. It is a story that has never fully been told. On the Army's series for television it is dramatically treated without becoming a mere travelogue. It is packed with human interest values which have been quickly spotted by the production staff of the Army Pictorial Center. Here is a story that has needed to be told--and the sooner the better. Just as the human and production resources of the nation are mobilized to provide the sinews of national defense, so are the spiritual and welfare resources of the nation mobilized through the USO to provide off-post welfare and morale building environments for American troops around the world. The USO is with them wherever they go. In this episode, the Army brings to the public the story of a job being done well. To the extent that the American people support the USO program, it is in a sense the story of the public's own effort. Featuring many of the \"greats\" from the world of entertainment, including Bob Hope, Joe E. Brown, and Edward G. Robinson, THE BIG PICTURE covers a span of current American history, familiar to the more than 15 million men and women who have seen duty in the service since 1941.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: United Service Organization (USO): Wherever They Go","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569724","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1968-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />Combat Operations, Hoi An, South Vietnam<br />ARC Identifier 31781 / Local Identifier 111-LC-52531 1968<br /><br />Department of Defense.

This is the story of the United States Army Signal Corps. An Army has been compared with a man, responding the way a man responds to danger. And it has nerves -- an intricate but vast sensory system spreading throughout the entire body, giving it sight, the ability to hear and the power to communicate. This complex nervous system which sensitizes the Army has a name. It is the Signal Corps. Throughout the world, wherever the Army stands, the Signal Corps keeps it alert. In making this picture, the camera crews visited Signal Corps engineering laboratories at Fort Monmouth, N.J., and the Army Electronic Proving Ground at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Television audiences will look at a simulated battlefield of the future, and see how some Signal equipment, and how communications systems developed at the proving grounds, would be employed. The operation of the new 100-inch camera with its infra-red lens, capable of penetrating 26 miles through haze, will be shown in reconnaissance missions. This is a new form of reconnaissance -- under atomic or non-atomic conditions.

In a half hour TV documentary filmed on location at Fort Rucker, Alabama, home of the Army Aviation School, viewers will see the story of air mobility in today's Army. The flexible, modern Army bears a family resemblance to the Army of 1918 and 1942, but that is where the similarity ends. Today, we must have a highly mobile, self-sufficient battle force. To control his widely dispersed elements, the ground commander must be constantly aware of the battle situation. He must know where the enemy is, and what he is doing. And, he must be able to transport his own forces to battle at top speed, at the point where they are most needed. It is here, that Army aviation is needed. In this program viewers will see how Army aviation moves men at 100 miles an hour, how the helicopter may replace the truck in moving supplies, and how the Army's new light aircraft give the ground commander \"eyes in the skies.\" The motto of the Army Aviation School, on whose training fields this program originates, expresses well this new concept of Army Aircraft in the Sky over Army Troops on the Ground... \"Above the Best.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Above the Best","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569612","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569638 / Local Identifier 111-TV-369<br /><br />Big Picture: Progress: U.S. Army<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Filmed on location in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Denver, Colorado; Blackfoot, Idaho; San Francisco, California; San Antonio, Texas; and New York City, \"Mister Army\" is a skillfully filmed documentary with an eye for detail, and ear for sound, and compassionate sensitivity for the little things.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Mister Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569640","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569644 / Local Identifier 111-TV-376<br /><br />Big Picture: Pictorial Report No. 30<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

The first story deals with the Code of Conduct for members of the Armed Forces of the United States. The Code is dramatically presented by a series of six posters. How these posters came into being is the basis for this report. The next coverage is given to \"Operation Red Corpuscle,\" a story of giving. It concerns an entire company of men stationed in Germany, and how they, as a unit, gave their blood that others might live. Another story takes place in Japan. It is about milk and how this nourishing liquid, taken for granted here at home, reaches Army personnel five thousand miles away in the Far East. The final feature starts in the United States and is really unfinished, for the leading characters may soon find themselves serving in the most remote corners of the world. This is the story of the men who are learning to operate the Army's newest source of power -- derived from the atomic reactor.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report No. 30","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569644","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569647 / Local Identifier 111-TV-379<br /><br />Big Picture: Pictorial Report No. 31<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Aided by the American Army, Japan turns to its youth and establishes an Officer Candidate School on the Island of Kyushu, to provide the best possible training for each young lieutenant. Begun in 1953, this newly formed military arm in Japan is dramatically filmed and presented as the first story on this pictorial report in THE BIG PICTURE series. On the other side of the world, in Germany, an activity of a lighter kind is photographed by Signal Corps cameramen. This second story deals with Army sponsored amateur little theatres, supported by funds from the Army Service Clubs and assisted by professional service personnel.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report No. 31","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569647","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569657 / Local Identifier 111-TV-389<br /><br />Big Picture: Armored Combat Power<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

History of Armor and today's Armor Team examined on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"Aggressively powerful, fast and mobile under all conditions, the Armor Team of the United States Army is a forceful deterrent to any would-be aggressor of the future.\" This is the theme in this week's episode of THE BIG PICTURE television series. This documentary follows the development of armor from early war chariot of four thousand years ago to modern tank in today's Army. The Armor Team as seen in this film is a deadly tentacle. It moves over the terrain, reaching deep into the heart of the enemy's forces, destroying pockets of resistance which have survived the atomic burst and supporting artillery fire. The emergence of the Armor Team on the field of combat has often decided the course of battle in modern war, and would decide it again if called upon. In armor there is strength and in strength there is victory.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Armored Combat Power","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569657","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569686 / Local Identifier 111-TV-421<br /><br />Big Picture: Pentomic Seventh Army<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. Every soldier assigned to the United States Army in Europe is either a member of the Seventh Army or is engaged in a task supporting the Seventh Army mission. That mission is a big one--serving as a bulwark of NATO's defense forces in Western Europe, protecting the free world from any type of aggression. THE BIG PICTURE takes you behind the scenes of this mighty Army, and places you right among the men who stand by twenty-four hours a day. You ride with a jeep patrol as it checks vigilant outposts along the West German border. You witness highly trained personnel with ultra-modern equipment go about their daily routine of serving one of the most efficient and mobile fighting forces the world has ever seen. Then, a moment's relaxation is observed in the mess hall until the alarm rings! Within minutes you see an Army prepare for war. A Corporal missile site is erected, and a simulated battle is enacted even down to mock casualties. The Pentomic Seventh Army is a symbol of America's military strength overseas--prepared to meet either a limited war or a nuclear attack. Through THE BIG PICTURE cameras, one can share the soldier's pride and confidence for this great and powerful organization.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pentomic Seventh Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569686","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569710 / Local Identifier 111-TV-450<br /><br />Big Picture: Airborne Soldier<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. HISTORY OF AIRBORNE SOLDIER TOLD ON \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- Here is a film documentary tracing the evolution of the foot soldier into the airborne soldier. It describes the various forms of transportation the fighting man has used to give him increased mobility and speed of movement. \"Airborne Soldier\" (TV-450) is an exciting spectacle. It recaptures tumultuous days in the past two decades when paratroopers have been used repeatedly with great success in global conflicts and in limited \"police actions.\" Credit goes to the men of airborne units for the vital missions they performed in World War II and in Korea. More recently, airborne soldiers were deployed in preventive actions and crises such as the Lebanon incident. This is shock action at its best on film for the Army's weekly television program. It is an absorbing study of highly trained fighting men who jump into combat. STRAC, the Strategic Army Corps, is examined at close range by the camera. Here is a picked group of the Army's finest trained, most seasoned battle troops, capable of aerial deployment of major striking forces anywhere in the world, combat ready and capable of aerial re-supply.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Airborne Soldier","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569710","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569717 / Local Identifier 111-TV-458<br /><br />Big Picture: History of Fire Power<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. HISTORY OF FIRE POWER TOLD ON \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"History of Fire Power\" is the story of man's weaponry from the caveman's punch to the missile man's firepower. Recalling man's repeated assurance that the \"ultimate has been achieved,\" the film goes on to show how he shrugs it off with a \"maybe so.\" From the dawn of history, the developing art of war has been a story of the struggle of military men to extend the range and power of the fist - the struggle to make it bigger, more effective, more capable of delivering a knockout punch. The United States Army has that \"knockout\" punch. Its mission is the defense of our nation and the stakes are greater than ever before. Some of the many fine aspects of the film deal with the Army's programs of research and development which continue to improve today's punch and strive to anticipate tomorrow's. Only in that way can the Army fulfill its mission. Only in that way can it assure itself that whenever and wherever the need arises, our bigger, stronger fist can strike to win.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: History of Fire Power","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569717","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569740 / Local Identifier 111-TV-491<br /><br />Big Picture: Decade of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense. Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). \"Decade of NATO\" is a film documentary, originally produced by the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, and narrated by Edward R. Murrow. As released on THE BIG PICTURE it becomes a report on the progress of NATO. It is history in the making. It is a story about this organization and its accomplishments since its birth more than ten years ago. In NATO we have developed a deterrent and a retaliatory capability of great destructive power for the prevention of general war. As stressed in this film episode for the Army's weekly television series, it is the fervent hope that one day the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will outlive the harsh facts of Communist aggression which called it into being. The nations of NATO are all partners, and have an appropriate part to play in international security today...tomorrow...and for the indeterminate future.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Decade of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569740","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569741 / Local Identifier 111-TV-492<br /><br />Big Picture: Army Language School<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

This is the story of the U.S. Army Language School which provides a program for training officer and enlisted personnel to meet Army requirements for linguists in at least one foreign language. As pointed out in the film, today forty percent of the U.S. Army serves throughout 73 different foreign countries. The contacts with the nationals of those countries offer both a challenge and an opportunity. Irrespective of rank and whether engaged in official duty or off-duty social pursuits, the overseas serviceman has become an important participant in the contest to win international friends. The most potent weapon in that struggle is language - the tool of direct communication. The film, after a close-range look at the operation of the school at the Presidio of Monterey, California, concludes by saying that with \"language\" as an instrument for building understanding and friendship we can look forward to closer ties with both the friendly and uncommitted nations of the world.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army Language School","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569741","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1953-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"Department of Defense.

The story of General George C. Marshall, told on Army's \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- This is a personal history film of General George C. Marshall who resigned from the Defense Department and settled in Leesburg, Virginia, in 1951. It is a pictorial record of his role as a public servant, spanning a critical half century, which ultimately placed him in the ranks of great American patriots. It is rare in history when a man who has distinguished his name in war goes on to greatness in peace.

With this issue of THE BIG PICTURE, sound cameras cover military activities in the nation's capital. This might be called the visitors' view of Washington. Through the camera lens, viewers will see the most famous of all military units in Washington -- the 3rd Infantry Regiment, whose origins go all the way back to the Revolutionary War. Only hand-picked officers and men are to be found in the ranks of the Third. Activities such as the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier will be shown. It is a simple ceremony, and yet an impressive one. Ceremonial color guards will be seen and interviewed at historic Mount Vernon. The story of the famed caparison horses at Fort Myer will be told. But not all the troops in the Washington area are for show and ceremony. Many fill jobs vital to the defense of the city and THE BIG PICTURE camera moves to the surrounding suburbs to show the anti-aircraft batteries. Following an alert, the cameras catch the men going into actions on the guns, the tankers of the 3rd Infantry rolling past the Pentagon, and the men of the 2nd Battalion moving to strategic positions as designated in Plan Able.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Military District of Washington","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569545","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569611 / Local Identifier 111-TV-342<br /><br />Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 23<br /><br />DVD Copied by IASL Master Scanner Liz Pruszko. Surgical research, story of portable TV, features of Army's TV show -- A three-way look at the latest Army news is featured on this week's edition of THE BIG PICTURE. Viewers of the award-winning television documentary will be brought up to date on Army Surgical Research, the new \"Creepie-Peepie\" and, as a special feature, will visit the Bavarian Alps on a G.I. holiday. Opening feature of this pictorial report tells the story of the Army's Surgical Research unit, a component of the great Brooke Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Here, Army medics and research scientists have been developing unique and dramatically successful methods of burn treatment. Viewers will follow several typical burn cases from the initial injury through the various stages of diagnosis and therapy. In any future conflict, experience gained in the Army's Surgical Research unit will bring comfort to a soldier when he needs it most. The BIG PICTURE cameras focus next on the Signal Corps' latest tool -- the portable TV camera. This cousin of the older walkie-talkie brings Army commanders a frontline view of terrain and troop deployments through a unique and completely portable TV camera, light enough to be strapped to one man's back. The program concludes with a visit to Germany's Bavarian Alps, where U.S. soldiers take a well earned alpine holiday. Viewers will see how men overseas can take leave in surroundings as spectacularly beautiful as any in Europe.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 23","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569611","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569617 / Local Identifier 111-TV-348<br /><br />Big Picture: Historic Fort Monroe<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert. Historic Fort Monroe and Continental Army Command activities shown on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- The Army's half-hour filmed TV documentary THE BIG PICTURE covers activities at historic Fort Monroe, Virginia, Headquarters, Continental Army Command. Here is an Army post which almost breathes tradition and in recent years has become an attraction for tourists from all over the country. MSgt. Stuart Queen, the series' host-narrator, takes his audience into the old walled fort, the only one of its kind in this country surrounded by a moat. It was in one of the small rooms of the fort that Confederate President Jefferson Davis was imprisoned, today known as the \"Casemate Museum.\" A standout job in photography has been accomplished in filming the interior of the lovely Chapel of the Centurion which serves as a post chapel. Hanging from the walls of the chancel and nave are the flags and colors of old regiments of the United States Army. The stained glass windows of the Chapel are dedicated to the military men who have served at Fort Monroe. On such a window is inscribed, \"He died so the kids next door may live.\" Additional coverage is given to activities of test boards in six different locales of the U.S. and the arctic test branch at Fort Greely, Alaska. Although old in history, Fort Monroe, home of the Continental Army Command, still plays a prominent and vital role in the national security of the United States.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Historic Fort Monroe","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569617","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569650 / Local Identifier 111-TV-382<br /><br />Big Picture: The History of Cavalry<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

The lusty history of the Cavalry depicted on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- With this issue of THE BIG PICTURE, the camera sweeps back through the pages of history to bring television viewers the story of the Cavalry in its long ride to glory. It is a long ride and a colorful one from the horse to the air, but that is the story of the Cavalry in the United States Army as dramatically filmed in this episode. It is both artistic and magnificent, and with the skillfully written narration voiced by Alexander Scourby it becomes one of the best, if not the finest, of THE BIG PICTURES produced by the Army Pictorial Center, Long Island City, New York. If THE BIG PICTURE has taken its cue from the recent success of westerns on television, then \"The History of Cavalry\" should certainly prove to be most entertaining. As expressed by the series' host, Master Sergeant Stuart Queen, \"Surrounding the very word 'Cavalry,' there is a warm glow of nostalgia -- of romance and valor. It is a sense of proud men fighting a proud cause with both dash and distinction.\" Then, as the story unfolds it becomes clear that the Cavalry's historic role in the defense of this country is one of the Army's most illustrious chapters and is well told on THE BIG PICTURE.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The History of Cavalry","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569650","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569664 / Local Identifier 111-TV-396<br /><br />Big Picture: Atomic Battlefield<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Cameras of \"THE BIG PICTURE\" focus on Desert Rock, Nevada -- In this issue of THE BIG PICTURE, the camera swings to the barren flats near Desert Rock, Nevada, where in the latest atomic blast, one of the new Army's Pentomic organizations was actually employed in the field in conjunction with an atomic detonation. Since this is the age of the atom, the importance of the Army and its mission--seizing and retaining control of the land -- takes on a new meaning. The land may he scarred and seared by weapons which stun the power of reason, but so long as it remains vital to victory it is the task of the soldier to secure it and hold it. The battlefield of the future, if it exists, may well be an atomic battlefield. As is explained in this film presentation, that brutal fact has forced upon the Army the absolute necessity of testing both men and tactical concepts under atomic conditions. In test blasts over the last few years, the Army has learned much about the response of the individual soldier. Out of the special needs imposed by atomic conditions -- the need for wide dispersion of forces, for instance --the structure of a combat force in the field has been developed to provide a mobility and a fluidity which troops in warfare have never had before.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Atomic Battlefield","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569664","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569713 / Local Identifier 111-TV-454<br /><br />Big Picture: Washington Soldier <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"Washington Soldier\" a pictorial report on nation's capital -- \"Washington Soldier\" is a film that young and old will enjoy. It is a look-see at a side of the nation's capital that the tourists seldom see as they pass through. There is a concert in the inner courtyard of the Pentagon with the United States Army Band, featuring PFC Steve Lawrence, and a tour of the famous five-sided building along the Potomac. Brought to the television screen on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" is the story of soldiers on duty in the Pentagon and assigned to Headquarters Company, United States Army, Fort Myer, Virginia. Written by Dan Klugherz and directed by Don Livingston, \"Washington Soldier\" examines the varied jobs of the men and women in uniform and the unique experience of being a part of the life of this great city. Featured in the leading role of this film is PFC Edward Griffiths, a former drama student at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Since the soldier on duty in Washington must also follow a monthly training schedule as well as perform his assigned tasks in the Pentagon, the writer has included field training sequences in the picture as well as a troop information program tour of the famous Civil War battlefield -- Manassas or Bull Run.

Basic training to graduation is theme for new \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"Operation Discovery\" depicts the life of a young soldier from induction into the modern Army until his ultimate \"graduation\" from basic. During the course of the film, he \"discovers\" the why and wherefore of his obligated peacetime service. Eddy Manson, one of this country's top harmonica virtuosos, is featured in this film in an impromptu rendition of \"The Ballad of Roger Young\" together with Jake Moon, guitarist and ballad singer. Manson, who journeyed to Moscow with Ed Sullivan, is a recording artist and has performed on many television programs. He's generally rated as one of the best in his field. The Roger Young ballad, which is used throughout the film, was written by Frank Loesser who was stationed at the Army Pictorial Center in Long Island City, New York, during World War II as an enlisted man. One of the few songs to survive the war days, it tells of the Ohio-born infantryman who died in the Solomon Islands fighting while heroically saving the lives of others. Except for Manson, Moon, and several other \"professionals,\" service personnel were used in the picture. Among these were Maj. Gen. Sidney Wooten, Commanding General of Fort Dix, New York; a company and battalion commander of the training regiment there; and Fort Dix enlisted men.

His is the task of keeping faith alive under the most difficult of conditions. The second story is from Europe and viewers will see an example of how the Army makes use of the scientific method in the detection of crime. Finally, our camera swings to Europe and Korea and a very unique school in the United States for bomb disposal students. THE BIG PICTURE shows that in addition to the physical ruin left in the wake of war, seeds for further destruction are oftentimes found which require trained military personnel capable of ferreting out these destructive seeds and removing them before the damage is done.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 7","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569534","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569541 / Local Identifier 111-TV-271<br /><br />Big Picture: Armed Forces Assistance to Korea<br /><br />DVD copied by Master Scanner Thomas Gideon.

Americans have traditionally responded to the needs of friends in trouble and for this film presentation in THE BIG PICTURE television series, American soldiers are shown as they lend a helping hand to Korea, a country torn apart by war. Here is a film documentary about a gesture which started as an informal assist and has mushroomed into a big, organized program for the rehabilitation of certain areas of Korean life. Armed Forces Assistance to Korea, or as it is generally known, AFAK, is an American Army project which is destined to become a living monument of friendship between peoples. This is a story about the aftermath of war in Korea and how, through AFAK, American soldiers are once again demonstrating how willingness and cooperation can overcome obstacles in helping a country make a comeback.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Armed Forces Assistance to Korea","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569541","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569560 / Local Identifier 111-TV-290<br /><br />Big Picture: Nurses in the Army<br /><br />DVD copied by Master Scanner Thomas Gideon.

Americans are well aware of the great and heroic achievements of United States Army nurses. In World War II and during the Korean War, the Army nurse went through great hardship in performance of her duty -- the same dangers endured by the troops which she accompanied into combat. But relatively little has been reported of the Army nurse in peacetime. Yet, she still serves -- not only in the States -- but all over the world. THE BIG PICTURE gives television audiences some impression of the work of an Army nurse overseas. Not only her work will be shown, but how she spends her leisure time and sometimes what she thinks and feels.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Nurses in the Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569560","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569632 / Local Identifier 111-TV-363<br /><br />Big Picture: Weather: Friend or Foe<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert.

THE BIG PICTURE goes behind barbed wire, protected by maximum security precautions, to visit the Evans Lab, which is a subdivision of the U.S. Army Signal Engineering Laboratory in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Of 500 scientists working here, over 100 are in the Meteorology Department. Through the eyes of THE BIG PICTURE camera we see one of the Army's largest research center -- a multi-million dollar plant -- which is required for the meteorology program. The Army's need to know more and more about weather that surrounds this planet is a vital part of the expanded research program of atomic weapons. We all talk about the weather.

Viewers will see the cannon that fought with Washington, a primitive weapon but good enough to pound the British at Bunker Hill, support the successful attack at Trenton, and aid in the defeat of Cornwallis at Yorktown. They will learn how artillery played a decisive part in winning the Battle of Gettysburg. Crammed into 28 minutes are stock shots of the allied Meuse-Argonne offensive that finally broke the back of the German Army in 1918; the Pacific campaign of World War II where artillery became the most effective weapon against the Banzai charge of the Japanese; and finally, Korea -- where American commanders traded manpower for firepower and once again artillery came to dominate the battlefield. Since artillery can never rest on past performances, THE BIG PICTURE examines pictorially the new concept of today for American artillery -- mobility.

COMBAT INFANTRYMEN TAKE TO THE WATERWAYS IN ALASKA TO ACCOMPLISH MISSION -- This is a filmed documentary about a river in Alaska which can serve as a military highway during the summer. The operation as assigned to combat infantrymen was a simulated attack on an Aggressor-held bridge. The distance to be covered was 100 miles by river, bivouacking one night en route. THE BIG PICTURE Signal Corps cameramen accompanied this small combat unit as it moved down this fast inland waterway on this most unusual training mission. On the screen, it looks like a kind of little flotilla deep in the heart of Alaska. There is danger at every turn and the cameramen capture on film all of the navigation skill learned by these combat troops. Broken-field running through river obstacles requires alertness and navigating skill. One error in judgment and you can kiss the mission goodbye. And the trickiest thing about it is that rivers change from month to month. There can never be any certainty of what lies ahead.

An American city salutes the Army on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- During this past summer, THE BIG PICTURE staff covered a very unusual activity in community relations, arranged by the Alexandria, Virginia, Chamber of Commerce, in recognition of the Army's important contribution to the social and economic development of the city of Alexandria. To show the cordial relations that exist between the civilians and the soldiers who live as friendly neighbors in the area, host-narrator MSgt. Stuart Queen prepared a film treatment and requested cameramen from the Signal Corps' Photographic Agency in the Pentagon to \"shoot the story.\" Alexandria's gesture in saluting the United States Army with a week devoted to expressions of friendly cooperation was a milestone in civilian-military relationships.

This was a spirit that could be duplicated throughout the country wherever civilians live in close contact with the citizen-turned soldier. \"Alexandria -- City of Understanding\" is a quiet, yet sincere documentary which has focused on this historic city in such a way that one feels the presence of the great Washington and the humble Lee.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Alexandria: City of Understanding","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569643","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569661 / Local Identifier 111-TV-393<br /><br />Big Picture: Individual Protection Against Atomic Attack <br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

(ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). \"THE BIG PICTURE\" presents effective measures against atomic attack -- THE BIG PICTURE presents a documentary film currently in use for training soldiers against possible nuclear warfare. Part of this training is to familiarize soldiers with actual atomic detonations, showing them the damage such weapons can inflict, and teaching them the most effective methods of defense against atomic attack. There is no minimizing the potency of the nuclear weapon. But today's soldier, well informed and well trained in test blasts over the last few years, has a better chance of survival on the nuclear battlefield. As explained by THE BIG PICTURE's host, MSgt. Stuart Queen, many of the methods employed by the Army in the training of its soldiers are equally applicable to the citizens of this nation in the event of atomic attack. Although the battleground of the future may well be a nuclear one and the nuclear weapon is perhaps the greatest challenge to the foot soldier in military history, the United States Army believes it is a challenge that can be met, and that today's soldier has a chance of surviving this new weapon just as the soldier of the past was able to survive the weapons of his day.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Individual Protection Against Atomic Attack","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569661","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569665 / Local Identifier 111-TV-397<br /><br />Big Picture: Army Satellites<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

First complete documentary on Explorers I and III produced for \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"Army Satellites\" reveals the dramatic, suspenseful story of how the Army--when the prestige of the United States throughout the world had been shaken by events beyond its control--stirred the hearts and emotions of the American people with an epic display of scientific and technical teamwork. The story depicts the drama of the crucial 84 days before launching Explorer I. The story begins on the morning of November 8, 1957, at Huntsville, Alabama. THE BIG PICTURE cameras cover a sudden meeting called by Major General John B. Medaris with his staff which included Dr. Wernher von Braun. From this point, the film develops with dramatic sequences leading into the final \"countdown\" in the blockhouse at Cape Canaveral, Florida. \"Army Satellites\" is an actual step-by-step documentary filmed over a five month period by Army Signal Corps cameramen and is narrated by Alexander Scourby. With this issue of THE BIG PICTURE, the series has reached a total of 229 individual episodes since it started in 1951 as a public service feature for television stations totaling 328 in the United States.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army Satellites","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569665","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569685 / Local Identifier 111-TV-420<br /><br />Big Picture: A Debt is Honored<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. Filmed in Philadelphia, this episode in THE BIG PICTURE series tells the story of an historic incident that took place in 1763 when the forerunners of Philadelphia's 111th Infantry Regiment (Pennsylvania National Guard) were besieged by Indians at Fort Pitt in the midst of the French and Indian War. They were rescued by the tough troops of Britain's Black Watch--the soldiers who, because of their kilts and ferocity, were nicknamed the \"ladies from hell\" in World War I. Since that time in 1763, the descendants of the 111th and the Black Watch Regiment have maintained a close and friendly association. Each year the 111th in Philadelphia reserves a vacant chair at the table during the annual ceremonial mess. The vacant chair is held in honor of the Black Watch Regiment. A 25-man camera crew from the Army Pictorial Center filmed the many activities that took place in conjunction with the ceremonial mess which was held at the Union League. Coverage was also given to the first professional football game to be played in the U.S. by two teams from across the border in Canada.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: A Debt is Honored","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569685","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569687 / Local Identifier 111-TV-422<br /><br />Big Picture: Alaska: The Outpost State<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. When Alaska was acquired by Secretary of State Seward almost a century ago for seven million dollars, it was promptly dubbed \"Seward's Folly\" or \"Seward's Icebox.\" Even up to the present day, many Americans consider their newest sister state as a barren rock covered with crushing ice and constantly at sub-zero temperature. Alaska is a rugged land to be sure, but, as this week's THE BIG PICTURE points out, she will prove a valuable star in our nation's flag. An area one-fifth the size of the continental United States, it boasts of modern cities, progressive schools, rich mineral and game resources and booming industries that have already returned our original purchasing price many times over. THE BIG PICTURE highlights Alaska's colorful early years of the Klondike Gold Rush, through its repulsion of a Japanese invasion during World War II, up to its admittance to statehood. The film presentation then defines Alaska's strategic value in military affairs which in recent years has grown to vital importance to national defense. With its original owner, Russia, just fifty-six miles from Alaska's border, it can truly be called the \"Guardian of our Northern Frontier\" and America's \"Outpost State.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Alaska: The Outpost State","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569687","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569729 / Local Identifier 111-TV-472<br /><br />Big Picture: The Seventh Army Story<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. Today the major American ground force in Europe is the Seventh Army. It is a combat-ready fighting force--with traditions and standards of which it can be proud. In telling its story, THE BIG PICTURE goes back to July 1943, when the Seventh was one of the great armies formed to crack the walls of fortress Europe. Film viewers will see the Seventh born at sea, on the way to its first campaign--the invasion of the not-so-soft underbelly of Europe. Its target-- Sicily. Commanded by General Alexander M. Patch--a soldier who roamed his front lines--the Seventh anticipated the German operation \"Northwind\" which came on New Year's Eve 1944 and continued for 23 days. Today, in exercises such as WINTERSHIELD in Germany, the Seventh trains with other NATO forces. The training emphasis is on combat readiness, and the training continues in terrain and under weather conditions as rugged as any Seventh Army encountered during World War II.

Civilian in peace, soldier in war--so begins the theme for this episode, titled \"I Am the Guard.\" Here is a film documentary which details the dedicated efforts of citizen soldiers toward maintaining the strength, fitness, and combat readiness of the Army National Guard as a full-fledged member of the Army team. Much of the production was filmed on location in and around Concord, Massachusetts, where one of the embattled farmers stood, and fired the shot heard around the world. Living among signs of the past, Guardsmen assigned to a Nike-Ajax site are seen reacting to an alert warning. Whether the alert is practice or the real thing, men of the Guard get to their posts on the double. As established in the film, an Unidentified Flying Object has been detected not far from the coast of Massachusetts. As a result of the alert, a large group of trained Guardsmen throughout a wide area of New England have been sent into action. In a final film montage, the many and varied roles of the Army National Guard are examined at close-up range.

In this presentation, THE BIG PICTURE takes viewers to the most northern body of land in the world to view the activities of Operation Lead Dog. A combined services effort conducted in cooperation with the Danish government and commanded by the Army Transportation Corps, Operation Lead Dog started in May of 1960. First, the Army explorers spanned the icecap from coast-to-coast before moving north beyond the areas covered by Peary's travels. The 65-day journey was designed to give the Transportation Corps a good opportunity for a rigid test of their polar vehicles for endurance and mobility. Other technical services made extensive equipment tests and gathered detailed data on the previously untouched polar regions. Archaeologists accompanying the expedition discovered the remains of a Paleo Eskimo camp, believed to be over four-thousand years old. Signal Corps photographers have dramatically filmed 20th century man's re-entry into the land where men fished and hunted more than two-thousand years ago.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Operation Lead Dog","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569742","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569747 / Local Identifier 111-TV-509<br /><br />Big Picture: Role of Armor<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

THE BIG PICTURE viewers will get an opportunity in this picture to see how armor has grown from a small group of specialists to the all-important role in in today's army. Signal Corps films present an authentic report of the first tactical employment of the iron combatants. Now accepted as an essential part of the fighting team on the ground, tanks were once considered impractical and ineffective. This episode records the slow evolution of today's rugged, reliable, hard-hitting, mobile forces. Authentic combat footage shows the successful employment of armored vehicles in World War II and in Korea. An indication of what lies ahead is also given with a view of the most modern armored vehicles being tested at Army proving grounds. A substantial following of World War II and Korean veterans, as well as those readers of Armor Magazine and members of the U.S. Armor Association who review the past triumphs of armor with considerable interest, will find in this documentary film a complete story that has long been waiting to be told.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Role of Armor","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569747","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569748 / Local Identifier 111-TV-510<br /><br />Big Picture: Special Digest<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

Produced and filmed almost entirely on the sound stages of the Signal Corps Pictorial Center, Long Island City, \"The Lodge Act Soldier\" brings to the television screen soldiers who have escaped from the Communist into the Free World. These same men who once trained in armies behind the Iron Curtain are today showing American soldiers what life in a Communist army is like, and thereby developing a greater appreciation among all Americans for the democratic way of life. Setting the pace for this most unusual film, M/Sgt Stuart Queen, host-narrator, points up the importance of understanding the Communist enemy. In 1950, to help further this end, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge sponsored the Alien Enlistee Program, now generally called \"The Lodge Act.\" Under the provisions of this legislation, political refugees from any country behind the Iron Curtain were given the opportunity to enlist in the United States Army for a period of five years. At the end of this time, if their record was honorable they would become American citizens. In addition to the first-hand accounts by Lodge Act soldiers, this BIG PICTURE program will include Communist training and newsreel films. In 28 minutes, television audiences will be given one of the clearest pictures about the \"soldier behind the Iron Curtain\" ever to be released.

Focus on the Middle East, latest \"THE BIG PICTURE\" telementary -- The exotic Middle East, from India to the eastern end of Africa, plays the featured role in this week's chapter of THE BIG PICTURE. Culled from over 15,000 feet of film made exclusively for THE BIG PICTURE, the program will describe how American Army Military Assistance Groups help train the soldiers of Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan. Military Missions, or Aid Groups, started in Latin America in 1926. Today's Military Missions (known as MAAGs -- short for, Military Assistance Advisory Group) have evolved from models established in Greece and Turkey in 1949. MAAGs are designed to provide a direct link between the United States and its friends abroad who are in need of American know-how and skill in training their own soldiers. The members of a U.S. Army MAAG not only help train other nation's troops but also extend technical advice on the use of modern equipment. The Middle East, in the headlines of the newspaper you read this morning, is particularly in need of American Army MAAGs. The Middle East is the crossroads of the world, linking Europe, Asia and Africa. Air routes depend on refueling bases in the Middle East. The oil reserves of the area are estimated to include 50% of the world's total. One hundred million people dwell in the Middle East. They must learn to protect themselves from Communist domination.

He is the result of good leadership which stems from concentrated training such as that performed at the NCO Academy in Germany. Every Army leader is important--from the man who wears stars on his shoulder to the man who wears stripes on his sleeve. This first subject in \"Pictorial Report Number 32\" deals with the Army leader who comes in closest contact with the men--the one who can influence the soldier greatly--the non-commissioned officer. In theory and in practice, the non-com guides his men, tests them, corrects them and often has their safety in his hands. Training the non-com to be a good leader is a vital job, carried on in many Army schools in this country. But leadership abroad, wherever soldiers are stationed, is also important. To tell this story the camera crews of the Army's TV series traveled to the Seventh Army NCO Academy in Munich, Germany. The second subject in this film report deals with the Berlin Horse Platoon which has been viewed by many thousands of Berliners and visiting dignitaries from all over the world. This is another type of Army training which provides one of the most unique and colorful of your Army's activities.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 32","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569660","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1971-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 34481 / Local Identifier 111-LC-57073<br /><br />AMERICAL DIVISION - SNIPER SCHOOL (23D INFANTRY DIVISION)<br /><br />Department of Defense.

The Rangers are a proud corps of elite combat-ready troops who undergo the most rugged training in the Army. The first Ranger unit dates back almost 200 years ago when the original thirteen colonies were under British rule. They served with General Washington's Colonial troops and they were active in Europe and the Pacific during World War II. When the Communist aggressors struck in Korea, the call for the Rangers sounded again.

Here is an exciting film documentary of the famous \"Indianheads,\" the men of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and the vital role they played in Korea. Although the fighting in Korea is over, the deeds of the 2nd Infantry Division will long be remembered. Out of the struggle in Korea have come many accounts of great suffering and even greater heroism, but few of them can match the story as told in this BIG PICTURE program. Through careful editing and with emphasis on \"close-ups\" of the men themselves, this outstanding documentary seems to tell the personal story of the soldiers of the Indianhead Division who lived up to their proud motto -- \"Second to None.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The 2nd Infantry Division in Korea","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569567","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569642 / Local Identifier 111-TV-374<br /><br />Big Picture: Provide for the Common Defense<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense. Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). Through civilian eyes \"THE BIG PICTURE\" examines the Department of Defense -- THE BIG PICTURE cameras follow a nine-day tour of representative American citizens of Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps Bases in this half-hour episode of the Army's weekly television series. This tour -- more often referred to as the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference -- is designed to acquaint the American public, through representative citizens, with the problems, workings and accomplishments of the Defense Department. It shows how and why defense dollars are well spent. During the past ten years, more than 1,500 Americans have been given an inside look at the Defense Department through the J.C.O.C. Program. Now THE BIG PICTURE brings this same view to its 30 million viewers.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Provide for the Common Defense","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569642","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration - ARC Identifier 2569653 / Local Identifier 111-TV-385 - Big Picture: Our Sons - Department of Defense.

THE BIG PICTURE examines in dramatic form the Reserve Forces Act in which the young men of America can fulfill their military obligations and do the best for their careers at the same time. Coupled together, here are two reasons why more and more forward-looking youngsters are enrolling in the United States Army Reserve.

Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). The story of the Army truck told on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- The subject of today's THE BIG PICTURE is rarely thought of as a weapon. But in a very real sense it is. In \"Many Roads to Glory\" we see just how large a role the Army truck has played in preserving the freedom of the United States in the twentieth century. Few people would argue that the Army truck is as powerful as an atom bomb, or as swift as a guided missile, but today, as in the past, the truck remains the workhorse of the Army. It is a lifesaver in time of civil disaster, and is always ready to move our fighting men, and to supply them with the tools for attack or with the weapons of defense, at home and overseas.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Many Roads To Glory","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569654","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569662 / Local Identifier 111-TV-394<br /><br />Big Picture: Pentomic Army<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

Pentomic Army flexibility shown on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- This is an age of streamlining, with everything from automobiles to guided missiles reflecting the dynamic look of the future. The United States Army is no exception, and with this in mind THE BIG PICTURE documents the new concept in this episode entitled \"The Pentomic Army.\" As shown, the Army's modern fighting division today is lean and functional, simple in organization and efficient in performance, keeping pace with the many marvelous inventions at its disposal. The Pentomic Division, so named because it consists of five battle groups, is a semi-independent, self-contained fighting unit designed to operate effectively on an atomic battleground, should the need ever arise. As pointed out in this film presentation, today's Pentomic Division is characterized by the ability of fewer men to deliver a more devastating concentration of firepower on any would-be aggressor.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pentomic Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569662","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569676 / Local Identifier 111-TV-409<br /><br />Big Picture: Army Newsreel No. 2<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

A cameo report on the life of American soldiers in Europe released on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"Army Newsreel No. 2\" is an adaptation of a newsreel prepared by the Army in Europe for showing to servicemen and women, their dependents, and Army civilian employees. Shown originally in Army motion picture theatres, this THE BIG PICTURE release deals with the lives of Army personnel on duty in Europe. Recorded for the newsreels by Army Signal Corps cameramen, \"Newsreel No. 2\" covers many subjects quite American in nature. Others reflect an international character. Still others are part of the recreational backdrop provided by the respective country in which the American and his family find themselves.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army Newsreel No. 2","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569676","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569691 / Local Identifier 111-TV-426<br /><br />Big Picture: Flying Soldiers <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"Flying Soldiers\" is a documentary film which dramatically presents the story of Army aviation. Viewers will see everything from a foot soldier to an Honest John missile. A simulated battle is staged for the cameras in which fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters rush vitally needed soldiers to the front. Also seen in this episode is the latest in Army aircraft -- the revolutionary \"Tilt-Wing,\" the Caribou, and the Mohawk. Today Army aviation is more than a new weapon. It multiplies the effectiveness of every new weapon we have now, and those we will have in the future. As pointed out in this THE BIG PICTURE release, today's Army must take to the air, which has no mud holes or traffic jams, no road blocks or narrow bridges. This is not the air 20,000 feet up or even 2,000 feet, but the air just above the treetops -- or better yet, in between the trees.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Flying Soldiers","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569691","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569692 / Local Identifier 111-TV-427<br /><br />Big Picture: The Patrol <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"Where is the enemy? What is he doing? How can we prevent it?\" THE BIG PICTURE presents \"The Patrol,\" the dramatic and exciting report of seven men sent deep into aggressor-held territory for the answers to these questions. Upon their skill, training, and fortitude can rest the outcome of an entire maneuver. As THE BIG PICTURE points out, thirty years ago such an assignment would have been accomplished by a lightening sortie of mounted men galloping headlong behind enemy lines, sowing confusion and, with luck, returning with the vital information. Today's cavalryman may not seem as glamorous but is certainly more reliable. In the course of their mission the patrol takes advantage of every form of transportation from helicopter to armored patrol car, to rubber raft, to combat boots. This is not a war \"game.\" It has the serious purpose of giving Army units field experience in the doctrines they have studied in training. In wartime, such a mission could well result in the prevention of thousands of casualties.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Patrol","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569692","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569695 / Local Identifier 111-TV-430<br /><br />Big Picture: People to People <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. Today THE BIG PICTURE looks at one of America's not-so-secret weapons. No scientists or engineers are studying the blueprints on it. It will never come off the assembly line or be fired from a launching pad. But the range and power of this weapon is tremendous even though about all the equipment it needs is a smile and a heart. Our Armed Forces -- with a sizable portion of its strength stationed at overseas areas -- is ideally situated to play a major role in the job of winning friends for America. Using post-war Germany as an example, THE BIG PICTURE shows the individual serviceman and his foreign allies cementing international comradeship on a \"people to people\" basis. A game of baseball, an invitation to Sunday dinner, a visit to the local orphanage produces a bond of goodwill between countries that is impossible to measure. The way American GIs overseas look at it, the artificial barriers separating people from people are continually being swept aside by one of our most powerful weapons -- friendship.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: People to People","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569695","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569745 / Local Identifier 111-TV-507<br /><br />Big Picture: Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) Fourth <br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

The Famous Fourth Infantry Division possesses a proud military history through two World Wars emerging today as a major element of the Strategic Army Corps. This historical documentary follows the Famous Fourth through its World War One exploits and continues by showing its important role in World War Two as it fought its way across the continent of Europe. With the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after World War Two, the Fourth Division assumed a major share in the responsibility of maintaining the peace and security of the free world.

The sound of a plane is heard. Inside the plane Iranian Special Forces paratroopers prepare to jump into a maneuver area. There is a sense of urgency as last minute commands in Farsi are given by the lone American among them, a United State Army officer. How this officer, Captain Paul Wineman, is trained in the military and language skills needed for his urgent task overseas is the subject of this week's documentary, \"Special Forces Advisor.\" THE BIG PICTURE camera crews followed Captain Wineman through training at Fort Bragg's Special Warfare School, the Army Language School at Monterey, California, and on to Iran.

The privilege of serving the United States Army in uniform is no longer limited to men. To prepare the women who will serve with the Regular Army, the Women's Army Corps recently opened a new training center at Fort McClellan, Alabama. THE BIG PICTURE camera goes to Fort McClellan to film and record this first good look at the new \"college\" for WAC officers and enlisted women. Since 1942 when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps was created, women training for service with the U.S. Army have had a number of temporary homes, ranging from Florida to Massachusetts, from Iowa to Virginia. Today, the permanent WAC Center is a cluster of 22 cream-colored buildings in a natural setting at Alabama's Fort McClellan. Today, women are playing increasingly important role in the nation's defense. Thanks to the modern WAC Training Center, graduates are better trained and better qualified for more responsible jobs than ever before.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The WAC is a Soldier, Too","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569547","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569550 / Local Identifier 111-TV-280<br /><br />Big Picture: Airborne to Battle<br /><br />DVD copied by Katie Filbert.

This is the first program in Series X to be released. It is a story about the history and development of the airborne Army. An exciting and dramatic film presentation, \"Airborne to Battle\" shows how the existence of a well-trained airborne Army, capable of moving anywhere on the globe on short notice, is an important factor in deterring aggression. The nations that control the air will control the peace. \"Airborne To Battle\" begins with scenes of the first controlled flights which took men into the sky. As the airborne story unfolds, viewers will see the first of the daredevil barnstormers who jumped from fragile wings to thrill Sunday crowds after World War I. Signal Corps cameramen catch the first combat jump by men of the U.S. Army -- an aerial assault on Sicily in July 1943. Since those early days, great strides have been made in the airborne story -- from an idea to a big reality. This is a remarkably fine film presentation on the subject of flying infantrymen -- human bolts of thunder striking from the sky and ever-ready to defend our country at a moments notice.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Airborne to Battle","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569550","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569559 / Local Identifier 111-TV-289<br /><br />Big Picture: The 24th Infantry Division in Korea<br /><br />DVD copied by Master Scanner Thomas Gideon.

This is the story of the 24th Infantry Division in Korea and of its magnificent performance. The 24th Division was formed out of the old Hawaiian division shortly before Pearl Harbor, and it fought bravely in many decisive battles in the Southwest Pacific that followed. With victory, it went on occupation duty in Japan. When war came again, the men of the 24th were the first Americans to reach the bitter and tragic soil of Korea. In this film presentation, viewers will follow the history of the 24th Infantry Division from their first difficult days of battle in Korea until November 1954, when the proud colors of the Division marched in Korea for the last time. This is the first program dealing with a division that fought in Korea. Five other division histories will be covered in subsequent programs to be released.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The 24th Infantry Division in Korea","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569559","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569561 / Local Identifier 111-TV-291<br /><br />Big Picture: NATO Maneuvers<br /><br />DVD copied by Katie Filbert.

Since its founding in April, 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has well proved its power for peace. It is a calm, studious approach to peace. Never before in history have Europe's rival nations formed such a working alliance. NATO-land is composed of 14 different nations with a combined Army seven million strong. Although NATO's buildup is almost done, this achievement required vast effort during 1954 -- a succession of training exercises conducted throughout Europe. This is a pictorial report on the NATO maneuvers of 1954. Beginning in March with Exercise Medflex Able which was held in the Mediterranean Sea near Gibraltar, these maneuvers were scheduled periodically throughout the year. Exercise Keystone in September was the year's largest maneuver and NATO cameramen followed the action which began near the Achilles Line in Northern Greece. Viewers will also follow the gigantic land maneuver, Exercise Indian Summer, held in the U.S. zone of Germany. Participating here are the 1st French Armored Division, the U.S. 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment.

The story begins on June 25, 1950, when the division was still in Japan. As filmed by combat cameramen of the Army Signal Corps, the history of the \"Tropic Lightening\" Division in Korea is told. Dedicated to all those men of the division--past, present and future--this film presentation follows the battle from a perimeter defense in the north near Sangju, through a dramatic shift under cover of darkness of 150 miles south to meet the Pusan-bent enemy, and back up the Korean Peninsula. Then, began Operation \"Mop-Up,\" a housecleaning, 25th Division style. As the war progressed, excellent footage was taken of the division on the outskirts of Seoul in January, 1951, as U.N. troops retired from the city. With the start of Armistice negotiations in July 1951, the division took up defenses along \"The Iron Triangle.\" Here, cameras caught the searchlight company in action, psychological warfare in extensive use, and finally, in May, 1953, the division's last major battle.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The 25th Infantry Division in Korea","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569564","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569648 / Local Identifier 111-TV-380<br /><br />Big Picture: 42nd Rainbow Division<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

History of famed 42nd Rainbow Division told on Army's \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- Memories of World War I are recalled in this most unusual documentary film in THE BIG PICTURE weekly TV series. Long hours spent in researching top film have uncovered some of the finest footage from World War I, covering the activities of the famed 42nd Infantry Division. To anyone who was around in those exciting days of the \"Great War,\" when the victorious troops were coming home to parades up Fifth Avenue and Main Streets throughout the country, the name \"42nd Rainbow Division\" rings a bell loud and clear. In World War II, as well, the 42nd Division contributed to the victory in Europe and their action is graphically depicted on film. Nowadays the hallowed insignia of the Rainbow is worn by the crack 42nd Division of the New York National Guard.

The United States Army, as almost everyone knows, is placing an ever-increasing emphasis on guided missiles, projectiles which can deliver deadly conventional or atomic warheads to enemy targets hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Perhaps the most remarkable fact about these amazing weapons is that they have all been developed in little more than a decade. The combination of nuclear weapons and guided missiles have, in a very real sense, revolutionized our concepts of warfare. Although the nation has entered a new era, it is not an era of \"push button\" warfare. For to function, one of these new weapons requires more soldiers, better-trained and more highly-skilled, than any other weapon in the history of war. \"Missile Man\" dramatically tells the story behind the training of these young men who are taking their places in tomorrow's Army. It is a picture dedicated to this new kind of soldier -- the Army Missile Man.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Missile Man","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569652","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569672 / Local Identifier 111-TV-404<br /><br />Big Picture: Missiles on Target<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense.

The story of how missiles hit their targets told on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- Today most television viewers have seen the drama of the launching pad when a long range missile is fired into the air. An orange surge of flame, a thunderous bellow of sound, then up it goes until as far as the naked eye is concerned it disappears into the skies. What then? Today's episode in THE BIG PICTURE is the story of \"What Then?\" It is the story of how long range missiles streak through the air to strike unerringly even a small target a long distance away. The film documentary begins a few miles from the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico one morning not long ago. As pointed out in the narration of the film, at the White Sands Proving Ground and other areas an elaborate, all-out testing and development effort is being pushed ahead daily. Not only are steps being taken to put long range missiles into the air and speed them vast distances, but if need be, to place their awesome destructive power squarely on the target.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Missiles on Target","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569672","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569688 / Local Identifier 111-TV-423<br /><br />Big Picture: Okinawa: Bastion in the Pacific <br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"You are the first soldiers of the new German Army.

It was in 1917 that the American Expeditionary Force under General John J. Pershing poured ashore in France, expecting to fight as a separate Army. However, it was not until July, 1918, that Pershing was able to create the First United States Army under his command. On film this episode becomes a chronological history of the First Army from World War I to 1960. It is an extraordinary documentary of the First Army's 23rd Division that wrote a chapter of history unexcelled in accomplishment, unsurpassed in courage. Many men and many outfits captured the imagination of the American people. There was Sergeant Alvin York of the 83rd Division, Wild Bill Donovan's Fighting 69th, Major Charles Whittlesey's Lost Battalion, General Douglas MacArthur of the 42nd Division, and the glamorous \"Hat in the Ring\" Flying Squadron of Major Eddie Rickenbacker. Inactivated in 1919, First Army seemed for a few years a part of the past. But the complacency of the twenties soon gave way to European unrest and in 1933, Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur recreated First Army as part of a broad Army reorganization.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Army's First","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569722","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569756 / Local Identifier 111-TV-518<br /><br />Big Picture: Silent Warriors<br /><br />DVD Copied by Liz Pruszko - Department of Defense.

This short film is about one phase of a brigade wide sweep search of Unidentified Radios Stations (URS) monitored in the AO of the Fifth Brigade, 1st Air Cavalry. A-company of the First Battalion was responsible for patrolling a four square kilometer area approximately 20 kilometers S-SW of the city Tan Linh, and 41 kilometers SSE of a larger city, Vo Dat, all in Binh Tuy Province. The footage covers four days of the mission during which time no contact was made with the enemy, and no recent signs of enemy activity were discovered. The mission was cancelled at the end of this time. Log day. Captain Eugene J. White of Springfield, VA, A-1/5 commander is seen briefing his platoon leaders and NCOs in preparation for the patrol. Mail call, water, supplies are secured for the patrol. Logging continued. A scout dog, Casey, is brought in. Casey is handled by PFC Joe Ertel of Gary, Indiana. Casey is on his third \"tour\" in Vietnam. A company's LZ lies approximately 500 meters from its patrol area, so the company must move out, separately by platoon, before setting up for the night. This roll ends as the second platoon, the Command Platoon, moves out. The method of this sweep consists of setting up temporary FOB sites (Field Observation Base) from which \"Poppies\" are dispached. These are squad size patrols that search the immediate area around the FOB. This roll is of such a poppy. Another poppy. The trail appears heavily, although not recently, used. An automatic ambush is set up. Back at the FOB site the men rest between poppies, read their mail still fresh from yesterday's log, eat chow, and then go out on another. Walking point for the 2nd platoon is SP4 John Zalot, Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Casey sniffed out some old NVA bunkers at an abandoned enemy base camp. We see a demonstration of Casey's bunker searching technique, and then the first platoon puts the torch to the vacated hooches. After 3 days and another log day. First bird to arrive brings Lt. Col. Bill Burkhardt, 1/5 Commander, to the field where he confers with Capt. White and explains the details of A company's new mission. Subsequent birds bring food, water, mail, and supplies. The company logged, it embarks on a Combat Assault. We see the men board the helicopters, and their arrival at their new AO.","title":"A-1-5 1st Air Cavalry, Binh Tuy Province","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.34265","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1967-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"Department of Defense.

THE BIG PICTURE cameras scan the globe for \"Army in Review,\" TV Report -- Secretary of the Army, Wilber M. Brucker introduces this week's edition of THE BIG PICTURE, the Army-produced documentary for TV. The Secretary of the Army makes this exclusive appearance on the long running Army TV series as a part of a \"Report to the People\" on the state of the American Army today. Titled, \"Army in Review,\" the show will bring citizens a capsule accounting of their Army and its global activities. The U.S. today is associated with 45 other nations in the most powerful system of collective security ever created. The Army stands guard, shoulder-to-shoulder with the troops of allies along the bamboo and iron curtains, as a potent reminder that we always stand ready to oppose any threat of aggression with the full force of the U.S. Army's might. In support of the nation's mutual defense commitments, nearly half (roughly 40%) of the U.S. Army's strength is stationed overseas. Staggering though the figure is, the American Army is represented today in 73 countries! This special chapter of the informative THE BIG PICTURE series, takes the viewer in his home on a tour of many of these 73 countries, ranging from the jungle heat of the Canal Zone to the frigid cold of the Arctic circle. Included in the program are scenes of the 280 mm Atomic Cannon, and the Nike, Honest John, Corporal and Redstone Missiles. This program will bring Americans everywhere a keener insight into the activities of the best-equipped, best-trained Army the nation has ever had.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Army in Review","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569613","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />Okinawa: Bastion in the Pacific<br /><br /> Department of Defense.

The German people now belong to a partnership of the free nations of the world. Without this mutual cooperation between all free nations, the defense of one nation would be impossible.\" So spoke Dr. Konrad Adenauer at the opening of Germany's new military defense system. In the time which has passed since the contingent of 1000 recruits arrived in 1956, the new German Army has grown to a well-trained, well-equipped force of 175,000 men. The fact that they are both well-trained and well-equipped is due in no small part to the few hundred specialists attached to the staff of the United States Military Assistance Advisory groups, or MAAG. This week's THE BIG PICTURE is the story of MAAG's efforts in helping to create a powerful allied force from the ruins of a war-torn land. In doing so, it also produced a strong camaraderie between the men of this organization and their American advisors.The United States, in its own interest--and other free nations in their interest--have joined a system of collective security in which the efforts of each nation sustains all.

Produced and filmed almost entirely on the sound stages of the Signal Corps Pictorial Center, Long Island City, \"The Lodge Act Soldier\" brings to the television screen soldiers who have escaped from the Communist into the Free World. These same men who once trained in armies behind the Iron Curtain are today showing American soldiers what life in a Communist army is like, and thereby developing a greater appreciation among all Americans for the democratic way of life. Setting the pace for this most unusual film, M/Sgt Stuart Queen, host-narrator, points up the importance of understanding the Communist enemy. In 1950, to help further this end, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge sponsored the Alien Enlistee Program, now generally called \"The Lodge Act.\" Under the provisions of this legislation, political refugees from any country behind the Iron Curtain were given the opportunity to enlist in the United States Army for a period of five years. At the end of this time, if their record was honorable they would become American citizens. In addition to the first-hand accounts by Lodge Act soldiers, this BIG PICTURE program will include Communist training and newsreel films. In 28 minutes, television audiences will be given one of the clearest pictures about the \"soldier behind the Iron Curtain\" ever to be released. They will learn from men who served in Communist armies and whose first-hand knowledge of communism is an invaluable asset to our Army.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Lodge Act Soldier","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569554","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569615 / Local Identifier 111-TV-346<br /><br />Big Picture: Boys Town, U.S.A.<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert. THE BIG PICTURE visits Boys Town, U.S.A. for story of young soldiers -- The U.S. Army's weekly TV program, THE BIG PICTURE moves its cameras and microphones to Boys Town, Nebraska, just outside of Omaha, to bring viewers the story of how our Army made it possible for young men of draft-age to prepare for their military obligations. The TV program will originate direct from the unique Nebraska landmark, founded by the late Father Edward J. Flanagan, and will describe participation of the youngsters in the Army's Reserve Program. Youngsters at Boys Town have joined the 353rd MP Company, organized under the provisions of the Reserve Forces Act of 1955. Many of the boys signed up for the new military program, whereby they are on active duty for 6 months, and spend a total of 7 1/2 years in the Reserves. Features of the plan allow the youths to complete their educations at Boys Town High School before being called to 6 months active duty. The men are draft exempt by joining the Reserves. Viewers will accompany the special Boys Town \"Company,\" the 353rd, as it performs its annual two-week summer training program. This year, the Men of Boys Town traveled with the Army to Ft. Carson, Colorado, where they received basic field training in military subjects. Rev.

Former secret military force shown for first time on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"Phantom Fighters\" (TV-448) is good strong film entertainment, worthy of the attention of every thoughtful viewer. It is a documentary about the Army's Tenth Special Forces Group in Europe, until recently a secret military force, now shown for the first time on THE BIG PICTURE. The story setting is in the vicinity of Bad Tolz which lies in an alpine valley near the German Swiss border. Resourcefully put together from film made in Germany by the Army Signal Corps, \"Phantom Fighters\" is a movingly meaningful television documentary about American soldiers trained to organize guerrilla resistance in enemy occupied territories. In a field training exercise, the many and varied skills of the Tenth are put to the test. They include a parachute jump, a mountain climb on skis, destruction of a bridge on the River Ammer, and a race to outdistance the enemy. It's a rugged, exciting life as evidenced on film and no soldier with Tenth Special Forces would have it any other way. Every man is a volunteer qualified to carry out hazardous and adventurous assignments. In no other branch of the United States military services is the standard of physical fitness higher than in Special Forces. Among the groups at Bad Tolz, a man's hand is as deadly a weapon as a rifle or hand grenade.

The first, \"United States Soldiers' Home,\" takes place not far from the busy center of our nation's capital -- in a quiet and pleasant suburb. Here, many men who have served faithfully in the Army or Air Force, are spending their days of retirement. THE BIG PICTURE camera looks at the Soldiers' Home through the eyes of one of its residents, First Sergeant George Burns. From Washington, the television camera swings South to the Panama Canal Zone to see young soldiers in training. They are officers from Latin American countries who are attending a U.S. Army School. The final subject is one of utmost importance to each and every citizen. It is a civil defense story that takes place on Long Island. As the camera moves through the area, a test air raid is being planned -- to be centered around the village of Great Neck where a simulated A-bomb attack will take place. For this test, the Army Signal Corps is cooperating by providing civil defense authorities with a television camera in a light plane above the bombed area.

Civilian engineers and helicopters documented on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- In spite of the fact that the Army has been in existence for some 181 years, during which time it has successfully defended the country in all of its wars, the need today is increasing for more trained engineers. These same engineers when employed by the Army become all-important citizens in America. Without engineers no nation can grow, and in this technological age no civilized nation can continue to exist without the constant efforts of highly-trained, scientifically educated men. In this week's pictorial report, THE BIG PICTURE compares this nation with the Soviet Union where engineers are being trained at an enormous rate for the Russians well realize where lie the springs of power in this technological age. For the second story in this film documentary, viewers witness the first arrival of an entire company of U.S. Army helicopters at an overseas base in an operational state. The 18th Transportation Company, composed of 21 Sikorsky H-34s, is transported to Bremerhaven, West Germany, aboard the aircraft carrier \"Corrgidor.\" From Bremerhaven, these same helicopters fly to Oberschleissheim, a long cross-country flight. The flying windmills are capable of reaching altitudes of over 11,000 feet, and of speeds exceeding 100 knots.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps program dramatized on Army's \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- How the United States finds and trains men of leadership ability on whom the nation can depend in time of mobilization is the subject for this THE BIG PICTURE film presentation. As explained in narration form, many of the officers come from ROTC--which is part of the curriculum of many schools and colleges throughout the country. ROTC is an integral part of college life for many students like \"Hank\" Miller, Cornell '54, about whom this picture has been written. Skillfully photographed on the campus of Cornell University and on the training field at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, \"Graduate--ROTC\" is a very sincere treatment of a subject that otherwise might become dull on motion picture film. It moves from classroom to football field, from parade ground to an Army Missile Command. Lieutenant Henry \"Hank\" Miller is shown as a member of a team of youthful missile men whose mission is the defense of the United States. His role is one that calls for active leadership that began with training several years ago when he was a freshman student at Cornell University. Without over-emphasizing the mission of ROTC, the viewer is left with a very clear-cut impression that without men trained like Lt. Miller, this nation would lose an advantage impossible to measure -- that of having capable military leaders for whatever eventualities may arise in the troubled world of today.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Graduate: Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569659","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569443 / Local Identifier 111-TV-173<br /><br />Big Picture: United Nations Forces Escape the Chinese Trap<br /><br />DVD copied by Master Scanner Liz Pruszko.

For this pictorial report, three subjects are covered by Signal Corps cameramen in Germany and Korea. The first, \"Berlin MP Patrol,\" takes place one hundred miles deep in the Soviet zone of Germany. Here, every day, one finds a silent but ceaseless struggle for supremacy between our way of life and the slave state way. From free Berlin, the camera moves westward to the next picture story. The locale is the \"Rhine Engineer Depot,\" most modern of its kind in Europe, located on the outskirts of Kaiserslauten, Germany. For the last story, THE BIG PICTURE camera crews film Army light planes in operation in Korea. The scene is the Eighth Army Airstrip.

The Army on horseback that once was the United States Cavalry is no more, for our Army today is a mechanized force. But \"cavalry\" is a proud word in military terminology and no one displays that pride more than the men of the 1st Cavalry Division. They call themselves \"troopers,\" like their tough forbearers who, a century ago, rode against the Indian tribes of the west. Today, these men of the division (sometimes called \"the first team\") keep alive the cavalry's legendary tradition of bravery by fighting, when they are called upon to fight, with courage and an indomitable will to win.

Bradley, the man of quiet dignity yet with a punch that packed a terrific wallop. Here on film is a pictorial history of an Army general who smashed ahead with a force of almost a million and a quarter men. A military leader's achievements are usually measured in terms of battles won. In the case of Omar Bradley, General of the Army, the scope broadens. His achievements are evaluated in the winning of a great war and laying the foundations for world peace.

Here is a tribute to the veteran; a warm salute to the soldiers (both professional and citizen-soldier alike) who have fought in all of this nation's wars, from the beginning. It is not a concise history of the United States Army, but rather an intimate look at the soldier's participation in that history. Action footage has been obtained from Hollywood which will take the viewer back to the days of the American Revolution. There are scenes that will convey a sense of individual bravery. Others are close-ups of men as they react to the pressures of war... fighting grimly and desperately... falling wounded... aching with weariness... happy in moments of relaxation... frightened in others.

During this 30-minute presentation, you will see how snowy wastelands are developed into a completely built city equipped with every convenience from a nuclear power plant to a shower.

This is the story about the men on duty in Panama -- one of the Western Hemisphere's most critical defense areas. Viewers will see some of the more unusual aspects of life in Panama. THE BIG PICTURE camera will cover many varied scenes in this tiny republic which is about the size of the State of Maine. From the new university near Panama City the camera travels to the ruins of the Church of San Domingo. It is here that the exploits of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan are recalled. Among the many interesting people that the soldier in Panama sees in his travels, are the Montunos, whose villages are in the interior. As one of our country's most important outposts, indispensable to our defenses and to the collective security of the Americas, the Panama Canal must be kept open and operating.

In observing this occasion, THE BIG PICTURE has prepared a reissue of its first program, and perhaps best remembered documentary of the Korean War, \"The First Forty Days.\" Although the title has been changed to \"Brush Fire -- Korea,\" this is a story of how a handful of men were locked in bitter combat with a ruthless enemy army of 5 divisions. A soldier of the Army Infantry tells the dramatic story of our first forty days in Korea--a glowing tribute to the officers and men of the 24th Infantry Division. Since the time when this first THE BIG PICTURE went on the air, there have been many revolutionary changes in the organization of the Army. The war in Korea hastened the development of this modern Army, which has come a long, long way from those first grim days when North Korean forces suddenly crossed the 38th Parallel. Korea was called by various names -- \"Brush Fire,\" \"Police Action\" -- but to the men who fought there, it was war.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Brush Fire: Korea","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569645","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569656 / Local Identifier 111-TV-388<br /><br />Big Picture: 42nd Artillery Group<br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert - Department of Defense. Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). Test alert in Germany shown on \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- Artillery, the king of battle, is closely examined by THE BIG PICTURE camera in the Seventh Army area in Europe. Viewers will see the 42nd Field Artillery Group in Germany wheel two of its most formidable weapons -- the \"Corporal\" guided missile and the 280mm cannon--into action for a test alert. The training these men in the 42nd Field Artillery Group undergo with their weapons is a representative chapter in the continuing story of the Army's development of firepower, which gives it strength and serves as a further deterrent to any future wars. In today's Army the tactical use of missiles is a reality. Mobile artillery weapons as demonstrated in this THE BIG PICTURE episode, are capable of massive concentrated firepower, such as was barely dreamed of in World War II. These same weapons can be used to support ground troops of the new Pentomic Division which have been reorganized to meet the demands of warfare on the fluid atomic battlefields of the future.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: 42nd Artillery Group","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569656","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569714 / Local Identifier 111-TV-455<br /><br />Big Picture: Germany Today<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. \"Germany Today\" to be shown on Army TV series -- This is the story of a people desolate in defeat, who found the way back with the help of the military force that defeated them. This is the story of the role played by the United States Army in the rebirth of West Germany. \"Germany Today,\" as seen through the eyes of \"THE BIG PICTURE\" camera, is an outstanding documentary of a vast reconstruction job. A cycle has come full turn. The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces which helped defeat Germany is hailed now by free Germans as friend and protector. No other force in military history has done so much to put a conquered nation back on its feet as the United States Army. Because the U.S. Army has been a bulwark, West Germany remains democratic -- a front line for this nation's security. As the film concludes, the narrator says, \"We do not know what future dangers may arise in Germany, but the United States Army is on guard and will be ready. The ringing of West Germany's Freedom Bell echoes in all free lands. It calls for eternal vigilance. It calls for readiness to defend freedom with all the power at our command.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Germany Today","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569714","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569728 / Local Identifier 111-TV-471<br /><br />Big Picture: Top Soldier<br /><br />DVD Copied by Timothy Vollmer. Since the creation of the National Security Act in 1947, which might be considered to coincide with the beginning of the modern Army, four men have held down the role of \"top soldier\"--the awesomely demanding job of Army Chief of Staff. In this episode of THE BIG PICTURE, the camera's attention is focused on the lives of these four generals and their contributions to the Army. The first of these four generals is General J. Lawton Collins who picked up the nickname \"Lightning Joe\" when he commanded the 25th Infantry Division in Guadalcanal in 1943. General Collins was succeeded in the Office of Chief of Staff by a West Point classmate--Class of 1917--General Matthew B. Ridgway. Ridgway's outfit during World War II was the 82nd Airborne Division. General Ridgway's successor was another officer who, like him, had emerged from World War II as a spectacular commander of airborne troops--General Maxwell D. Taylor. After General Taylor, came the man who occupies the office of \"Top Soldier,\" General Lyman L. Lemnitzer. On film, \"Top Soldier\" becomes an excitingly-made and excellently written documentary about Army leadership.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Top Soldier","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569728","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1945-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"Department of Defense.

The nurse is depicted flipping the pages of the chart and making notations on several pages. The patient whose chart is being examined is also depicted in this shot. The first part of this roll depicts a medical cart with various bottles on it. The group of bottles shown in this shot are the ones containing sulfur mylon. There are two bottles of sulfur mylon in the cart. One, the large bottle contains 10% Mafenide HCL (Hydrocloric Acid). The small bottle contains 5% Mafenide HCL. Also depicted with the bottles is an atomizer (spray applicator). Sulfur mylon is the solution that is a major part in the healing and recovery of the burn patients. The above was shot two times.

Dr. Lieu listens to the patient's abdomen in the first shot. The second shot shows the patient's blood pressure being taken. The next shot shows an intravenous cathedor being inserted into a patient's arm. This shot was a sudden thing that came up in the emergency room. Not much of the procedure is shown because the Vietnamese doctor who is performing the insertion is blocking the camera's view. The final shot on this roll shows a bottle of dextrose. A CU of the bottle and the air bubbles as the dextrose is fed into the patient's arm is shown. This footage depicts Doctor Lam listening to the abdomen of a small boy burned on the face, chest and lower extremities of his body. This was shot two times. The first take will be no good.

Department of Defense. Department of the Army. Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. (ca. 1974 - 05/15/1984). Here is a pictorial report covering two subjects, both of which have been very skillfully handled and which should create considerable interest to viewers. The first subject pertains to the educational facilities provided by the Army for the children of American servicemen in Germany. Since the end of hostilities in World War II, quite a few members of the Army who go overseas are permitted to take their families along with them. Furthermore, the Army sees to it that the children in these families are provided with an adequate American-type of education. As the report unfolds, it becomes clearly evident that the kind of educational opportunities offered overseas are of the highest standards. The second report is in the form of a letter from a mother of an American soldier inspired after she had visited her son at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It is an exceptional letter, picked from a great many written by civilians to military commanders. It is a mother's feelings, expressed very well, very simply and honestly. Granted permission to quote her own words, Mrs. Charles Porter Atherton of Exeter, New Hampshire, was invited to re-visit Fort Bragg so that THE BIG PICTURE camera might photograph her tour. The result is an impressive film report which shows not only the deep affection of a mother for her son, but a fine understanding of the role her son must play in the defense of his country.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 9","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569548","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"Department of Defense.

Appearing in this film is West German Chancellor Dr. Konrad Adenauer: Army's THE BIG PICTURE to feature \"The New German Army\" documentary for TV -- Feature film of the \"new\" German Army will make its American TV bow on the U.S. Army - produced documentary, THE BIG PICTURE. This unusual program, now in its sixth national telecasting season, spotlights the political, economic, and social background which brought about the creation of a military force for the free, Bonn Republic of West Germany. Appearing in the film is West German chancellor, Dr. Konrad Adenauer. In flashback form, using captured German film of World War II vintage, this exciting chapter of THE BIG PICTURE traces the rise of the German nation, from the bitter depression days of the 1930s, through the rise of the Nazi party to the infamous \"Blitzkrieg\" of Sept. 31, 1939 - the invasion of Poland. In striking fashion, the producers of the program summarize, pictorially, the forces which led to the ultimate downfall of Germany as a world power. The postwar partition of Germany is shown, and viewers are shown the famed, \"Berlin Airlift\" of 1949. An important plank in the founding platform of the NATO nations is the creation of a German Army. The addition of a free West German force will bolster the ranks of NATO nations in their unified stand against aggression. The American Army was assigned the important task of training the nucleus of this \"new\" German Army. No relation to the earlier German \"Wehrmacht,\" this German Army will serve as a home guard, protecting free Germans from border violations from the East. Finally, the cameras swing to the U.S. where visiting Germans get the know-how to take back home. They have come to the very best instructors in military projects -- American Army officers and men, shown in this program, at the task of training the leaders of \"The New German Army.\"<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: New German Army","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569609","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"title":"War As It Really Is - Reel 6","description":"Department of Defense.

For the United States Army, television promises to revolutionize battlefield communications by giving the commander something he has never had before--communication by sight. The first subject in this pictorial report deals with a public demonstration of the use of television in combat. Staged at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, this demonstration as seen through the eyes of THE BIG PICTURE camera, shows the full spectacular scope of the changes television may one day bring to the battlefield. The second feature tells of the importance of the individual soldier. Today, throughout the world, he is doing many different kinds of jobs. One of them, shaped into vital significance by the course of current history, is the job of patrolling the borders which separate the free world from the Soviet orbit. In Germany, where this report was filmed, patrols are on the border every day of the year. The last report is about a military ceremony -- Retreat. Rich in tradition, this ceremony is graphically told with an original music score composed and conducted by the United States Army band.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: Pictorial Report Number 8","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569542","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />ARC Identifier 2569631 / Local Identifier 111-TV-362<br /><br />Big Picture: The Aggressor <br /><br />DVD Copied by Katie Filbert. The aggressor -- a maneuver enemy -- captures \"THE BIG PICTURE\" -- \"The Aggressors,\" a giant training aid of the United States Army, was formed after World War II at Fort Riley, Kansas. Their job: to create as realistic a maneuver enemy as possible so that combat training will approach the feeling of actual combat. In the first half of this most unusual THE BIG PICTURE, audiences discover the Aggressor Amy, Member Circle Trigon Party, have liberated large areas of the continental United States, but because of their success, THE BIG PICTURE viewers have been kept from the facts. This is a short documentary showing the liberation of the United States to date. After setting the pace for this program in the first 15 minutes, the camera examines closely this gigantic training aid of the Army. It is explained that at the close of World War II, a board of 100 combat-experienced American generals was formed to recommend training policies for the future. Out of these recommendations came the Aggressor concept of a maneuver enemy. The general mission of the Aggressor Army was threefold: First, to provide a realistic enemy for maneuver training; second, to provide realistic situations for intelligence training; third, to make sure that all American soldiers are aware that any future enemy will look and act differently from what they are accustomed to.<br /><br />","title":"Big Picture: The Aggressor","identifier":"gov.archives.arc.2569631","creator":["National Archives and Records Administration"]},{"date":"1939-00-00T00:00:00Z","description":"National Archives and Records Administration<br /><br />CAPTAIN BARTLETT'S PRE-WAR FILM OF THE ORIENT<br /><br />Department of Defense.

Air transportation has changed the shape of the earth so that these days, the shortest distance between vital areas is over the top of the globe. This is the polar concept.

To depict a combat situation, the picture ranges from scenes showing a division-wide alert to the assault parachute jump putting the 82nd into \"war.\" The division gets an assist from other XVIII Airborne Corps units cast in the film.
